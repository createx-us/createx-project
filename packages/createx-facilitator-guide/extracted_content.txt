--- Page 15 ---
1.0 Opening Story
“A blank page is the universe in disguise.”
In 1943, engineer Isamu Noguchi was confined in an Arizona internment camp. Deprived of
tools, he fashioned sculptures from scavenged wood and clay, turning constraint into catalysis. His
story reminds us that creativity is not a luxury of circumstance but a mindset that reframes limits
as invitations.
1.1 Defining Creativity
At its simplest, creativity is the capacity to generate ideas, artifacts, or actions that are
simultaneously novel and appropriate within a given context. Each discipline, however, colors
the edges of that definition:
Lens Core Insight
Psychology Creativity blends divergent thinking (fluency, flexibility, originality,
elaboration) with convergent judgment to select promising options.
(Guilford, 1950; Runco, 2004)
Neuroscience fMRI studies link creative idea incubation to dynamic switching
between the default‑mode network (daydreaming) and executive
control network (evaluation).
Anthropology Creativity is a social contract: Igbo “nkà,” Japanese “monozukuri,”
and Silicon Valley “innovation” valorize different outputs, norms, and
success criteria.
Reflection Prompt ①
Recall a moment when you produced something new and useful. Which of the three lenses above
best explains why it “worked”? Jot down thoughts before moving on.

knowledge, heuristics, and perspectives—produces more adaptive solutions.

1.4 The Role of AI in Human Creativity
16

--- Page 17 ---
Large‑language models, generative imagery, and analytic copilots expand our ideational
bandwidth but do not replace human judgment. Three complementarity modes:
1. Spark: LLMs supply provocative starting points when the team is “stuck.”
2. Stretch: AI simulations expose hidden edge cases and inspire bolder prototypes.
3. Sharpen: Realtime critique (readability scores, bias flags) accelerates refinement.
Ethics Watch: Creators remain accountable for truthfulness, bias mitigation, and contextual
appropriateness of AI‑assisted content.
1.5 Putting It into Practice
1. Divergence Drill – Set a timer for 5 minutes and list as many uses as possible for a
coffee mug. Stop at 30 seconds left and ask ChatGPT for five additional, unexpected
uses. Observe overlaps and surprises.
2. Constraint Remix – Take an existing product idea and force‑fit a new constraint (e.g.,
“must be zero‑waste”). Note how the idea shifts.
3. Collective Upgrade – Share your idea in a group, then run a “1‑2‑4‑All” session to
evolve it. Compare solo vs. collective output.
1.6 Key Takeaways
● Creativity = Novelty × Usefulness relative to context.
● Myths obscure the incremental, democratized nature of creative work.
● Cognitive diversity and structured collaboration outperform lone‑genius models.
● AI is a lever for sparking, stretching, and sharpening ideas—never a shortcut around
human empathy and ethics.

Chapter 2 — A Brief History of Design Thinking
Design Thinking is more than just a buzzword—it’s a rich tapestry woven from decades of
creative problem-solving approaches. This chapter invites you on a journey through time,
exploring how design thinking evolved era by era. Each phase of this history contributed a new
thread to the fabric of design-driven innovation, leading up to the practices we champion at
CreateX today. As facilitators, educators, and innovators, understanding this journey will
enrich how you guide others in design-driven learning and transformation.
Imagine standing in a long hallway lined with workshops. In each workshop, a different
generation of designers is hard at work—Bauhaus craftspeople shaping modern forms, 1970s
planners untangling wicked problems, software teams in the 1980s co-designing with users,
IDEO innovators brainstorming with sticky notes, lean startup founders testing prototypes, and
today’s creatives collaborating with AI. Walking down this hallway, you witness the
evolution of design thinking—from humble beginnings in art and industry to a global
movement tackling business and societal challenges. Every stop in this journey offers lessons,
metaphors, and tools that you can carry into your own facilitation practice.
In the sections that follow, we’ll visit six key eras in the history of design thinking. In each era,
we highlight real-world stories, influential models, and powerful metaphors that defined that
time. We’ll also explore how these historical developments connect to CreateX’s mission of
design-driven learning and transformation. You’ll find templates or models from each era—like
the Stanford d.school’s famous process or the Lean Canvas—along with tips on how you can
apply or remix these in your workshops. To spark imagination, we even suggest visual prompts
illustrating each phase, so you can picture the scene or perhaps generate an image for your
presentation. Let’s begin our time-traveling design adventure!
Bauhaus & Early Industrial Design (1919–1960): Crafting a Modern Vision
18

--- Page 19 ---
The story of design thinking begins in the early 20th century, when artists and engineers first
joined forces to rethink how we create things. A shining example is the Bauhaus, founded in
1919 in Germany, where visionaries like Walter Gropius and his colleagues imagined a new way
of blending art, craft, and industry. In the Bauhaus workshops, students learned by doing:
metalworkers, carpenters, painters, and architects sat side by side, shaping materials into
functional, beautiful objects. They believed in “form follows function,” the idea that design should
serve a purpose for people and not just adornment. This era planted the seed for
human-centered design, emphasizing that understanding materials, users, and context leads
to better solutions.
Real-world example: Think of the iconic Bauhaus furniture and products – like Marianne
Brandt’s sleek metal teapots or Marcel Breuer’s steel-tube Wassily Chair. These designs weren’t
just stylish; they were radically user-centric for their time. Breuer’s chair, for instance, was
inspired by bicycle handlebars, using lightweight steel to create a form that was comfortable and
could be mass-produced. This early focus on combining usability with elegance foreshadows
the user-first mindset of modern design thinking. Across the ocean in the 1940s and 1950s,
industrial designers like Henry Dreyfuss were sketching out airplane cockpits and thermostats
with the end-user in mind. Dreyfuss even created personas – “Joe” and “Josephine” – fictitious
everyday users, to remind his teams who they were designing for. These stories show a growing
awareness that design starts with empathy for the person who will use the product.
Metaphor: Picture this era as a foundation being laid for a cathedral of creativity. Bauhaus
masters and mid-century designers were mixing concrete – the fundamentals of form, function,
and empathy – on which future generations would build towering innovations. Just as a solid
foundation ensures a building stands strong, the principles from 1919–1960 ensure our modern
design practices stand on firm ground: interdisciplinary collaboration, user focus, and marrying
aesthetics with usefulness.
Template/Model Spotlight – The Bauhaus Basic Course: At the Bauhaus, every student
began with a “basic course” (Vorlehre) where they explored materials (wood, metal, clay, color)
and basic design principles (contrast, rhythm, proportion). This educational model – learning by
playful exploration – is something you can apply today.
Facilitator tip: Try a warm-up exercise inspired by Bauhaus teachings: give participants simple
materials (paper, blocks, wire) and a quick design challenge (e.g., “build a tool to carry water
without using a cup”). Encourage them to explore form and function hands-on. It’s a fun nod to
the Bauhaus spirit that loosens up creativity and emphasizes that experimenting with materials
can spark fresh ideas.
Visual Prompt: An early 20th-century workshop scene in black-and-white: young designers in
aprons and rolled-up sleeves bending over workbenches at the Bauhaus, surrounded by
geometric lamps, chairs, and abstract art pieces. The atmosphere is one of intense focus and
collaboration, as art and industry converge into modern design.
Systems Thinking and Wicked Problems (1960–1980): Embracing Complexity
19

--- Page 20 ---
By the 1960s, designers were facing challenges that a pretty chair or sleek product alone
couldn’t solve. The world was getting more complex, and design had to widen its lens. Enter
systems thinking – an approach that encourages looking at problems as part of a whole,
interconnected web. Designers, influenced by thinkers like Buckminster Fuller (famous for his
geodesic dome) and academics exploring General Systems Theory, began to ask: “How do all
the parts fit together?” In parallel, urban planners and policy designers grappled with social
issues that seemed unsolvable. Horst Rittel in 1973 dubbed these messy challenges “wicked
problems” – problems so tangled that every solution seemed to spawn new issues. Instead of
shying away, designers in this era leaned into complexity, mapping out problems, stakeholders,
and ripple effects before chasing solutions. This era taught the design world that context is
key: to design a part, you must understand the whole.
Real-world example: One illustrative project was the redesign of city services in the 1970s.
Imagine a city trying to improve its public transportation system. Instead of just designing a new
bus, designers created diagrams connecting housing policies, traffic patterns, fuel costs, and
even cultural habits of commuters. These “systems maps” looked like spaghetti at first
glance—circles and arrows connecting factors in a giant flowchart on the wall. But they helped
reveal leverage points (for instance, how adjusting bus frequency affected employment in
certain neighborhoods). Similarly, in corporate settings, companies like IBM and Bell Labs
started adopting system diagrams to plan complex technology products, ensuring that
hardware, software, user training, and support systems all worked in concert. The lesson was
clear: understanding relationships between parts can illuminate where a design intervention will
have the most impact.
Metaphor: Envision a kaleidoscope – when you peer inside, you see a complex pattern made
of many colored pieces. Twist it, and the pieces shift in unison to form a new pattern. The
1960–1980 era taught designers to view problems through a kaleidoscope of perspectives. A
change in one piece could rearrange the whole picture. As a facilitator, you too can encourage
this kaleidoscope view: every participant might hold a different piece of the puzzle, and when
they twist their perspective slightly, a new solution pattern can emerge.
Template/Model Spotlight – Wicked Problem Framing: To tackle wicked problems, designers
in the ’70s developed ways to frame the challenge before jumping to ideas. One approach was
to clearly list out all the stakeholders and their needs, and then pose the problem as a
provocative question that acknowledges its complexity (e.g., “How might we improve public
transit in a city where budget, climate, and cultural habits are all constraints?”). Another tool was
systems mapping, which you can try with your team.
Facilitator tip: When facing a big, hairy problem in a workshop, have the group co-create a
simple systems map. Start by writing the core problem in the center of a whiteboard. Ask
participants to brainstorm all the factors or players related to it (economic, social, technological,
etc.) and draw them as nodes around the problem. Then encourage them to draw arrows
showing connections or influences (does A affect B? Does X lead to Y?). The result might look
messy, but that’s okay! This exercise, much like a 1970s design team’s strategy session, helps
everyone see the problem as a whole system. It often sparks insights: someone might say, “Oh,
20

--- Page 21 ---
if improving public transit also reduces pollution, maybe we can get environmental groups on
board to help,” — a realization that comes directly from seeing connections. Emphasize that it’s
fine to embrace the mess; clarity will emerge through discussion.
Visual Prompt: A meeting room in the 1970s with designers and planners crowded around a wall
covered in paper. On the wall is a hand-drawn flowchart in marker: bubbles labeled with things
like “City Budget,” “Riders,” “Traffic,” “Environment,” all connected by arrows. The people have
70s attire and earnest expressions, collaboratively untangling the wicked problem with pens in
hand and coffee cups nearby.
Rise of HCI and Participatory Design (1980–1995): Putting People in the Loop
As personal computers and digital technology began to enter everyday life in the 1980s,
designers faced a new frontier: how to make technology more human-friendly. This period
saw the rise of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) – a field dedicated to improving the way
people interact with computers – and the spread of participatory design, where the end-users
become active collaborators in the design process. No longer were designers working in
isolation; they were sitting down with users, watching how people actually used a software
interface or a device, and co-creating solutions. It was a shift from designing for users to
designing with users. This human-centered ethos deepened design thinking: empathy and
observation became as important as artistic skill.
Real-world example: In the mid-1980s, teams at Xerox PARC and early software companies
pioneered techniques like “usability testing”. For instance, to design a new word processing
interface, they would invite people (secretaries, writers, everyday office workers) into a lab to try
out prototypes and give feedback. Observers often sat behind a one-way mirror noting where
users struggled or smiled. These tests led to breakthroughs like the desktop metaphor (folders
and files on a screen) which made computers feel more familiar. Meanwhile, in Scandinavia,
participatory design was in full swing – factory workers and nurses were invited to brainstorming
workshops to design better tools for their jobs. A famous project in the early ’90s involved
hospital nurses helping to design a scheduling software, cutting through what managers thought
was needed to what nurses actually needed on the ground. This inclusive approach ensured
the solutions truly fit the people they were meant for.
Metaphor: Think of design in this era as a conversation rather than a lecture. Instead of
designers “lecturing” their ideas onto a product, they engaged in a dialogue with users. Every
usability test or co-design workshop was like listening to a partner in conversation. When you
facilitate today, remember that design is a two-way street: by listening deeply, as designers did
in the HCI age, you empower users to “speak” into your design process.
Template/Model Spotlight – User Persona & Scenario: One of the tools that emerged in the
1990s to keep designs grounded in real user needs was the user persona – a fictional
character representing a key user group. A persona might be “Mary, a 32-year-old teacher who
is tech-shy but needs to organize her lessons.” Designers would refer to Mary throughout
development: “Would Mary understand this feature?” Alongside personas, designers used
21

--- Page 22 ---
scenarios – short stories of a persona using the product or service (e.g., “It’s 7am, Mary opens
the education app on her aging laptop…”). These simple templates help keep discussions
empathetic and concrete.
Facilitator tip: Try introducing personas in your next workshop. If a team is designing, say, a
learning app, have them sketch out 1-2 personas first. Encourage details and even give them
names and backstories. Then, when teams brainstorm solutions or make decisions, prompt
them to consider, “What would [Persona] feel or do in this situation?” This practice, born from
the HCI and participatory design era, helps keep the user in the loop of every decision. It also
makes the design challenge more relatable – participants often grow fond of their personas,
almost like characters in a story, and that emotional connection fuels their motivation to design
something truly useful.
Visual Prompt: A cozy 1990s computer lab with clunky CRT monitors. One side of the room
shows a user sitting at a computer, concentrating, as an observer with a notepad watches
behind a glass window. On a table, there are printouts of a “persona” profile with a sketch of a
character named Mary and notes about her needs. The vibe of the image is collaborative and
experimental, capturing the birth of user-centered design methods.
IDEO and the Stanford d.school (1991–2009): Design Thinking Hits the Mainstream
By the 1990s and 2000s, the term “Design Thinking” was gaining mainstream traction, thanks
in large part to innovative firms and academic hubs that championed it. One beacon of this
movement was IDEO, the design firm formed in 1991 that became famous for its eclectic teams
and creative methods to solve just about any problem. Around the same time, at Stanford
University, David Kelley (one of IDEO’s founders) helped create the Hasso Plattner Institute of
Design, known as the d.school, where students from engineering, business, medicine, and
more came to learn design thinking together. This era catapulted design thinking from specialist
circles to popular culture. Business magazines wrote about it, business schools taught it, and
organizations from banks to NGOs started saying, “Let’s try this design thinking approach!”.
Many of the tools and terms we now use in CreateX workshops were born in this time, and
CreateX’s mission of design-driven learning carries forward this era’s belief that design
thinking is for everyone. For facilitators today, this era is like the Renaissance of design
thinking – it produced many of the tools and terms we now take for granted.
Real-world example: Perhaps the most famous illustration of design thinking in action was
IDEO’s shopping cart project. In 1999, an ABC Nightline documentary followed an IDEO team
as they redesigned the shopping cart in just one week. Viewers saw multi-disciplinary team
members (an engineer, a biologist, a marketing expert, etc.) interviewing shoppers in a grocery
store, brainstorming wildly in front of whiteboards covered with sketches, prototyping a cart with
PVC pipes and wheels, and even testing it by zooming it through the parking lot. This was
design thinking on full display: empathy (talking to real shoppers), ideation (wild brainstorming
with no judgment), prototyping (quick and dirty models), and iteration (trying it out and refining).
The result was a funky-looking cart with a detachable basket and improved child seat—far from
22

--- Page 23 ---
traditional, but solving many observed user needs. Innovation can be systematic and fun at
the same time.
Meanwhile, at Stanford’s d.school, projects like the “Extreme Affordability” class had student
teams designing affordable products for developing countries, leading to breakthroughs like
low-cost infant warmers. The d.school’s influence spread a mindset: that anyone (not just
designers) can learn and apply design thinking to create social impact.
Metaphor: Think of the 1991–2009 period as a wildflower meadow in bloom. After many
seasons of preparing the soil, suddenly design thinking blossomed everywhere – bright, diverse
ideas pollinating industries from healthcare to IT. As a facilitator, you can channel this flourishing
energy. It’s the idea that with the right environment and a mix of minds, creativity will naturally
sprout.
Template/Model Spotlight – The Stanford d.school 5-Step Process: The Stanford d.school
distilled design thinking into a five-stage model that many organizations use today:
1. Empathize – Immerse yourself in the users’ experience. (For example, interview people
or observe them to discover their needs and feelings.)
2. Define – Clearly articulate the problem based on insights from Empathize. (Reframe it
as a clear design challenge, like “How might we create a safer, easier shopping cart
experience for families?”)
3. Ideate – Generate a range of possible solutions. (Brainstorm without constraints; go for
quantity and defer judgment—wild ideas welcome!)
4. Prototype – Build a quick, tangible representation of one or more ideas. (This can be a
sketch, a role-play, a cardboard model—something the team can interact with.)
5. Test – Try out your prototype with users and get feedback. (See what works, what
doesn’t, and iterate.)
This model is not a strict recipe but a playful guideline – teams often loop back and forth
between steps. Facilitator tip: Use these five steps as a roadmap in your workshop agendas.
You might even print them big on the wall. Encourage participants to embrace each mindset in
turn: wear the “empathy hat,” then the “analyst hat,” then the “creative hat,” and so on. Remind
them it’s not about following steps rigidly, but about balancing exploration and focus. The
d.school process is popular because it’s simple and memorable – feel free to adapt it. For
instance, CreateX facilitators often add a reflection moment after Testing, or mix in a “Discovery”
phase before Empathize to research context. The key is to make it your own, just as this era
made design thinking accessible to all.
23

Visual Prompt: A vibrant scene in a Stanford d.school classroom circa 2005. Students of diverse
backgrounds are clustered around a wall of Post-it notes, some sketching, some holding a
prototype made of cardboard and duct tape. The room is plastered with hand-drawn diagrams
and big words like “Empathize” and “Prototype” on posters. The feeling is energetic and
optimistic, capturing design thinking’s mainstream moment.
Lean, Agile, and Business Innovation (2010–2019): Scaling Design for Impact
In the 2010s, design thinking crossed paths with the fast-paced world of startups and the
structured world of corporate management. The result was an explosion of hybrid frameworks
blending design with lean and agile methodologies. This era asked: How can we make sure our
brilliant ideas also make business sense and can be delivered quickly? Lean Startup principles
(popularized by Eric Ries around 2011) emphasized rapid experimentation: build a “minimum
viable product,” test it with real users, learn, and iterate. Meanwhile, Agile methods from
software development (like Scrum) championed breaking work into sprints and constantly
adapting. When these met design thinking, we got a powerful trio of desirability, viability, and
feasibility – ensuring solutions are lovable for users, sustainable for business, and doable with
technology, all in tight feedback loops.
Real-world example: Take the rise of Airbnb. In its early days (circa 2009–2011), this startup
embraced design thinking by deeply understanding travelers and hosts (desirability), but it also
used lean experimentation – for example, they famously tested how professional photographs of
rental listings might increase bookings by just trying it in one city and measuring results. It
worked, and they scaled the insight. Many startups followed a similar pattern: identify a user
pain point, brainstorm a clever solution, then quickly prototype a business around it using lean
tests. In the corporate arena, companies like IBM launched massive design transformation
initiatives mid-decade: IBM hired hundreds of designers and trained thousands of employees in
design thinking, while integrating these efforts with agile product teams. The company even
created IBM Design Thinking with its own loop (Understand, Explore, Prototype, Evaluate) and
hills (goals) framework to marry user outcomes with business goals. The overarching theme
was making design a repeatable, measurable part of innovation – not just a one-off creative
sprint, but a new way of working continuously.
Metaphor: Picture a startup garage fused with a corporate boardroom. There’s the scrappy
energy of entrepreneurs tinkering and pivoting, combined with the strategic planning of
executives ensuring scalability. The 2010–2019 era blended these worlds. It’s like jazz
improvisation meeting a symphony orchestra – freedom and structure playing in harmony. For a
facilitator, this era reminds you to balance creativity with pragmatism. It’s inspiring to dream
big, but always be ready to test those dreams in the real world and iterate.
Template/Model Spotlight – Lean Canvas: A standout tool of this era was the Lean Canvas,
adapted by Ash Maurya from the earlier Business Model Canvas. This one-page template lets
teams sketch out their whole strategy on a single sheet. It includes blocks for the Problem,
Solution, Key Metrics, Unique Value Proposition, Channels, Customer Segments, Cost
Structure, and Revenue Streams. By filling in these boxes, a team ensures they’ve thought
24

--- Page 25 ---
about not just the user and solution (design thinking’s turf) but also how the idea will survive as
a business.
Facilitator tip: Try using a Lean Canvas or a similar business-model mapping tool in your
workshop, especially if you want participants to consider implementation. For example, after a
team comes up with a great concept for a new educational app, hand them a Lean Canvas and
have them spend an hour on it. They might realize, “Oh, we didn’t think about how to actually
reach high school teachers with this app,” which will prompt them to refine the design or
marketing strategy. The Lean Canvas injects a dose of realism and encourages
cross-disciplinary thinking. Also, consider introducing a bit of Agile flavor into your sessions:
you could run a “design sprint” where teams have five days (or five hours) to go through design
thinking steps, time-boxing each stage. This encourages focus and momentum. Many
facilitators in corporate settings also started using Kanban boards or simple dashboards to
track team progress (e.g., To Do / Doing / Done columns for prototyping tasks) – a nod to
DesignOps (Design Operations) which emerged to help scale design practices. In large design
teams, DesignOps dashboards began to visualize design projects and user feedback in real
time, making creative work more measurable and manageable. The goal is to keep the creative
chaos organized enough that it can deliver results consistently.
Visual Prompt: A modern workspace with a mix of startup vibe and corporate polish. One wall
has a large Lean Canvas poster filled out with colorful notes. A small team gathers around a
table with laptops and coffee, while a Scrum board in the background shows tasks in columns.
Perhaps one person is presenting a graph of user test results. The image conveys a blend of
creative brainstorming and analytical tracking, hallmark of the lean/agile design era.
AI-Augmented and Data-Driven Design (2020–Present): The New Frontier
The 2020s have ushered in a wave of technological advancements that are reshaping how we
practice design thinking. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data analytics are no longer
futuristic ideas; they are tools designers use here and now to augment creativity and
decision-making. This era asks a bold question: What if our design partner isn’t only human?
Designers today might brainstorm alongside an AI that suggests hundreds of variations, or use
algorithms to personalize a product in real-time for each user. Data-driven design means we
leverage vast amounts of user feedback and behavior data to inform design decisions (for
example, tweaking an app’s layout based on millions of clicks and swipes). Meanwhile,
AI-augmented design can mean using machine learning to generate design options — say, an
AI system proposes dozens of ergonomic chair shapes optimized for comfort, which a human
designer then refines. Importantly, the core of design thinking remains human-centered even
now: empathy, ethics, and creativity are more crucial than ever, as we have powerful new tools
that must be guided responsibly.
Real-world example: In recent years, tools like DALL·E and Midjourney (AI image generators)
or GPT-3-like assistants have begun to act as creative collaborators. For instance, a product
design team at a furniture company might use an AI image generator to instantly visualize
hundreds of chair concepts from a text prompt, then pick a few promising ones to prototype
25

--- Page 26 ---
physically. This accelerates exploration in the early stages of design. Companies like Google
have published design guidelines for AI (e.g., Google’s “People + AI Guidebook”), recognizing
that designing with AI requires thinking about things like trust, transparency, and user comfort.
Data has also become a design material: Netflix famously A/B tests details of its user interface
with different audiences, letting data subtly steer design decisions about what artwork or layout
best engages viewers. And during the COVID-19 pandemic, design thinking workshops
themselves went online, using digital whiteboards and video chats, proving that the process
could adapt – even giving birth to new remote collaboration techniques that we keep today.
Metaphor: The present era is like exploring a new frontier with a trusty compass. The frontier
is full of shiny high-tech tools (AI, data analytics, AR/VR), akin to discovering electricity and
engines in a new land. But our compass is the timeless set of design thinking principles:
empathy, define, ideate, prototype, test (and iterate). No matter how high-tech our tools, those
principles keep us oriented towards true north – making things that truly improve human lives.
As a facilitator, you are like an expedition guide in this landscape: encouraging your team to try
these new tools and paths, but also reminding them to check the compass (their
human-centered values) frequently.
Template/Model Spotlight – AI Ethics Checklist: With great power (of AI and data) comes
great responsibility. Modern design teams have started using ethical checklists and data
privacy impact maps as part of their process. For example, an AI Ethics Checklist might
include questions like: “Have we audited our data set for bias?”, “How will we explain this AI’s
decisions to users?”, “Did we get user consent for using their data in this design?” Similarly,
when designing with data, teams might create a simple Data Flow Map to visualize how user
data enters and moves through their system, ensuring transparency and privacy safeguards at
each step.
Facilitator tip: Bring ethics and modern tools into your workshops. If teams are ideating an
AI-powered solution, introduce a role-playing exercise where one participant is the “AI ethics
guardian” who challenges the team with questions from an AI Ethics Checklist whenever they
propose a new feature. This keeps the discussion grounded in responsibility.
Also, consider leveraging AI as a tool for creativity on the fly: for instance, you might use an AI
text generator to overcome brainstorm block (“Let’s ask the AI to suggest 5 wild ideas and see if
it sparks our own imagination”) or use an image generator live during a session to create quick
storyboards. These techniques can energize participants – they feel like they have a sci-fi
superpower at their fingertips – but always debrief afterwards: ask the group what the AI missed
or got wrong, reinforcing that human insight is irreplaceable. The goal is to make participants
comfortable with new tools while reinforcing critical thinking about technology’s role.
Visual Prompt: A futuristic design studio where a human designer and a friendly robot (or AI
avatar on a screen) are working together. The human is sketching on a digital tablet, while the
AI displays several generated design options holographically. Data charts and user feedback
stats float in the background. The mood is optimistic and collaborative, highlighting technology
and humanity working hand-in-hand in the design process.

Field Notes for Facilitators
Having journeyed through the history of design thinking, let’s distill a few takeaways and
practical pointers. This final section is your cheat sheet of insights – part inspiration, part caution
– as you integrate this rich history into your CreateX workshops.
● Every Era Has a Lesson: Each historical phase contributed something valuable to
today’s practice:
1. Bauhaus (1919–1960): Interdisciplinary creativity and hands-on learning.
2. Systems Thinking (1960–1980): Embrace complexity and see the big picture.
3. Participatory Design (1980–1995): Listen to users and co-create solutions.
4. IDEO/d.school (1991–2009): Anyone can tackle thorny problems with a playful,
human-centered process.
5. Lean/Agile (2010–2019): Balance empathy and creativity with business savvy
and speed.
6. AI/Data (2020–present): Leverage new tech and data responsibly to amplify
design.
● Mindset Over Methods: While it’s great to use models like the d.school process or Lean
Canvas, emphasize the mindsets behind them. The history shows that being
empathetic, collaborative, and iterative is the real secret sauce, regardless of the tool.
Encourage a mindset of curiosity like a Bauhaus novice, of patience with complexity like
a 1970s planner, of humility and listening like a 1980s UX researcher, of optimism and
experimentation like a d.school student, of practicality like a lean startup founder, and of
ethical awareness like a modern AI designer. Methods will change and new buzzwords
will come and go, but these mindsets endure.
● Ethical Watchpoints: Design has immense power, which means ethical responsibility is
a constant through the ages. Remind your teams of a few watchpoints:
1. Inclusivity: Early design eras often overlooked certain groups (e.g., products
assumed an average user like “Joe” and “Josephine”). Today, we strive to include
diverse perspectives. Check that your solutions consider people of different
backgrounds, abilities, and needs.
2. Sustainability: From the industrial age to now, design can impact the
environment. Ask, “Are we designing in a way that’s sustainable for the planet?”
27

--- Page 28 ---
3. Privacy & Consent: Especially in the data/AI age, ensure user data is handled
with care and consent. No solution should sacrifice privacy for convenience
without consideration.
4. Avoiding “Design Worship”: Design thinking isn’t a magic wand. It’s a toolset and
mindset. Be wary of overselling it or forcing it everywhere. Sometimes other
approaches (or a hybrid) are needed – and that’s okay.
● Workshop Integration Checklist: Here are a few practical ways to weave historical
insights into your sessions:
1. Start with a Story: Kick off a workshop with a quick anecdote from design
history to set the tone. For example, “Did you know a team of designers once
reinvented the shopping cart in 5 days? Here’s what we can learn from them…”
This sparks curiosity and situates your participants in a bigger context.
2. Era-inspired Activities: Design a small activity borrowing from an era. Maybe a
Bauhaus-style warm-up (playing with craft materials), or a 1970s-style
stakeholder mapping of the challenge at hand, or a quick usability test role-play
like in the 1980s. This not only energizes the session, but also honors the origin
of those practices.
3. Visual Timelines: Show a simple timeline of the design thinking evolution on a
slide or wall. As you move through your workshop phases (empathize, ideate,
etc.), you can point out which eras introduced certain concepts. (“We’re
brainstorming now – a practice that really took off in the 1950s and later became
central at IDEO.”)
4. Reflection and Connection: End sessions by asking participants what era or
story resonated with them most. Did someone feel particularly connected to the
idea of wicked problems, or the participatory approach? This helps them
internalize the mindset and see themselves as part of the ongoing story.
5. Keep Learning: The field keeps evolving. Encourage curiosity about new
developments (like whatever comes after AI-assisted design). Share resources
(books, articles, videos) if participants want to delve deeper into design thinking’s
rich history. As a facilitator, staying informed will keep your workshops fresh and
grounded.
In summary, design thinking’s history is a treasure trove of inspiration. It reminds us that
creativity can shape the world – from Bauhaus workshops to modern hackathons – and that we
are all part of this creative lineage. Use these historical insights as your fuel. They can ignite
pride (in carrying forward a tradition), humility (that we build on others’ work), and courage (to
28

--- Page 29 ---
push the boundaries further). When you facilitate a CreateX workshop, you’re not just teaching
a method – you’re empowering people to write the next chapter in this story of design-driven
transformation. Go forth and make history!
Chapter 3 — The Science of Creative Confidence
Part I Foundations of Creativity & Design Thinking
3.0 Opening Story
“I’d never drawn in front of people before.”
When civil‐engineer‑turned‑facilitator Ana Mendoza ran her first CreateX workshop in Bogotá,
she asked participants to sketch user journeys. Her hand shook—until one teammate said, “Your
messy lines help me risk my own.” By day’s end every table was plastered with imperfect but
telling sketches. Ana’s leap sparked a chain reaction of courage: textbook creative confidence in
action.
3.1 What Is Creative Confidence?
Coined by IDEO founders David & Tom Kelley, creative confidence is the self‑belief that you
can create positive change and the willingness to act on that belief, even under uncertainty.
Psychologist Albert Bandura calls the underlying construct self‑efficacy—“I can do
this”—which predicts persistence, resilience, and performance across domains.

Chapter 4 — Mission & Principles of CreateX
Part II The CreateX Framework
4.0 Origin Story
“What if design thinking were an open‑source movement, not a gated curriculum?”
In spring 2022, a loose coalition of educators, makers, and AI researchers met in a reclaimed
Shanghai warehouse. Their goal was modest: host ten free design‑thinking workshops for
under‑resourced schools. Within a year the initiative had blossomed into 300 workshops across
five continents. That exponential leap required a shared mission clear enough to unify strangers,
yet flexible enough to honor local nuance. CreateX was born.
4.1 Mission Statement
“Unlock one million acts of creative confidence by 2030 through open, AI‑augmented
design thinking.”
33

This mission has three operative verbs: unlock (remove barriers), acts (bias toward doing), and
confidence (internalize capability). The 2030 horizon aligns with UN SDG cycles and provides
urgency without frenzy.

Part II The CreateX Framework
5.0 Opening Story
“I’m not here to impress you; I’m here to make you impressive.”
During a 2024 hybrid sprint for a Singapore fintech, facilitator Luis Tan noticed senior managers
deferring every decision to him. Mid‑session he swapped roles with a junior analyst, letting her
steer the whiteboard while he asked clarifying questions. The room relaxed, laughter surfaced,
and idea flow doubled. Luis demonstrated the first rule of CreateX facilitation: shift the spotlight
from expert to enabler.

Chapter 6 — Process Overview: The CreateX Double‑Diamond × Sprint Loop
Part II The CreateX Framework
6.0 Opening Story
“We finished a whole ‘diamond’ before lunch.”
At a Montréal civic‑tech hackathon, facilitator Sofia Bélanger challenged her cohort to compress
a full Discover‑to‑Define cycle into three hours, powered by live‑transcribed street interviews and a
GPT‑4o clustering bot. By midday, teams had reframed their briefs twice and were already
ideating. Sofia’s experiment illustrates CreateX’s signature rhythm: macro structure with micro
speed.
6.1 Why a Process Overview?
● Common Language Unites multidisciplinary teams in minutes.
● Predictable Cadence Reduces cognitive load so energy focuses on insight, not
logistics.
● Plug‑and‑Play Allows facilitators to swap methods or AI tools without breaking flow.

Chapter 8 — Sense‑Making Methods
Part III Methods & Tools
8.0 Why Sense‑Making?
Research yields raw fragments—quotes, photos, observations. Sense‑making transforms that
noise into patterns, insights, and opportunities that spark productive ideation. Skipping this
step risks “solutioneering” on superficial hunches. This chapter presents five CreateX‑approved
synthesis methods you can combine inside the Define stage or inject later to realign drifting
teams.

Rapid Sprint 1) Solo draft 3 HMWs each. 2) Share round‑robin. 3) Up‑vote top 5.
AI Prompt “Generate 10 divergent HMWs from this insight: adjunct professors lack
Ideas stable Wi‑Fi.”
Pitfalls Questions too broad (“How might we improve education?”) or solution‑baked
(“…with an app”).
Template createx.us/toolkit/hmw‑generator
8.6 AI‑Assisted Synthesis Workflow
1. Upload raw transcripts → 2. LLM summarizer (preserve verbatims)
3. Vector cluster (UMAP) → 4. Human annotate & merge themes
5. GPT rewrites → Insight statements → Auto‑generate HMW drafts
Ethics Note: Retain original quotes for auditability; don’t discard minority themes just because
frequency is low.
8.7 Choosing & Sequencing Methods
Constraint Suggested Stack
Single‑Day Workshop Affinity → Insight → HMW → 2 × 2 (skip journey map unless flow
critical).
Complex Service Journey Map first, then Affinity by stage, Insight, HMW.

Chapter 9 — Framing & Opportunity Prioritization
Part III Methods & Tools
9.0 Why Framing Matters
A brilliant prototype built on a poorly framed problem is lipstick on a pig. Framing distills insights
into focused challenge statements; prioritization ensures limited resources chase the
highest‑value opportunities. Together they act as the hinge between Define and Develop.
9.1 Point‑of‑View (POV) Statement
Formula Example
[User] needs a way to [verb need] “Adjunct professors need a way to keep lesson files
because [surprising insight]. synced because campus Wi‑Fi cuts out every
15 minutes.”
Section Details
Purpose Translate empathy into a crisp problem frame.
61

--- Page 62 ---
When to Use After insight statements; before HMW brainstorming.
Step‑by‑Step 1) Draft solo, 2) Pair‑share, 3) Refine wording, 4) Quick vote for
resonance.
AI Prompt Ideas “Rewrite this insight into a POV statement, keep < 25 words, highlight
causality.”
Pitfalls Cramming solutions (“…need a Dropbox‑like app”).
Template createx.us/toolkit/pov‑canvas
9.2 Problem Statement Canvas (5Qs)
Q Guiding Prompt
Who Which user segment suffers most?
What Observable pain or unmet aspiration?
Where Context or channel where issue arises?
Why Now Trigger or urgency factor?
Win Success metric if solved?
Fill as a group, then sanity‑check against research evidence.

Use one quantitative model plus a visual matrix to triangulate.
9.8 AI‑Driven Prioritization Flow
1. Import opportunity list + metrics
2. GPT suggests missing data → team validates
3. Auto‑calculate RICE & ICE
4. Bubble chart outputs to BoardX 2 × 2
5. Human debate & finalize top 3 bets
Ethics Note: Never let AI pick alone; it lacks context on strategy, values, or politics.
9.9 Common Pitfalls & Fixes

Part III Methods & Tools
10.0 Why Ideation?
With insights framed and priorities chosen, it’s time to diverge boldly. Ideation converts
carefully defined challenges into a wide portfolio of potential solutions. Quantity precedes
quality: the more ideas generated—and remixed—the higher the odds of discovering
breakthrough concepts. CreateX blends classic creativity games with AI co‑ideation to
super‑charge output while preserving human originality.

Chapter 11 — Prototyping Methods
Part III Methods & Tools
11.0 Why Prototype?
Ideas are hypotheses; prototypes are experiments that turn talk into testable evidence. A
prototype’s fidelity should match the question you need answered—no higher. Rapid, disposable
artifacts accelerate learning, reduce gold‑plating, and create a shared “third object” the team
can critique without ego.
Golden Rule: Prototype to learn, not to validate what you already believe.
11.1 Prototype Fidelity Ladder
Fidelity Typical Question Time to Example Tool
Build
Sketch / Paper “Does the flow make sense?” 5–15 min Pen & Post‑its
74

--- Page 75 ---
Click‑Dummy “Can users navigate it?” 30–60 min Figma / BoardX
Wizard‑of‑Oz “Will users pay / respond?” 1–4 h Hidden human + scripted
UI
Functional MVP “Does it deliver value at 1–4 weeks Bubble, React, low‑code
scale?”
Facilitator Tip: Start one rung below what the team thinks they need.
11.2 Storyboarding
Section Details
Purpose Visualize user journey and uncover missing steps before building interface.
When to Use Immediately after Concept Poster; when flow, emotion, or setting matters.
Step‑by‑Step 1) 6–8 panels; 2) Stick‑figure sketches; 3) Caption per panel; 4) Group
walkthrough.
Remote Tips Use BoardX “Storyboard‑6” template; paginate left→right.
AI Prompt “Generate a one‑sentence caption for each storyboard panel summarizing
Ideas user intent.”
Pitfalls Over‑describing text instead of drawing; remind “pictures first.”

Chapter 12 — Testing & Feedback Methods
80

--- Page 81 ---
Part III Methods & Tools
12.0 Why Testing?
Prototypes reveal assumptions; testing reveals truth. A well‑run test answers three questions:
1. Usability — Can users accomplish the intended task?
2. Desirability — Do they want the solution?
3. Viability — Will the concept drive the target outcomes?
Skipping tests risks scaling defects, wasting time, and eroding stakeholder trust. CreateX pairs
lean, high‑signal tests with AI analytics to speed insight without sacrificing rigor.
12.1 Think‑Aloud Usability Test
Section Details
Purpose Surface friction points by hearing users verbalize thoughts while performing
tasks.
When to Use First pass on any clickable or paper prototype.
Step‑by‑Step 1) Recruit representative user (N = 5 covers ~85 % issues). 2) Explain “think
aloud” rule. 3) Give task one at a time. 4) Observe; take structured notes. 5)
Debrief user.
Remote Tips Use BoardX split‑view: prototype on left, live transcript on right.
AI Prompt “Highlight hesitations (> 2 s pause) and summarize in a table with timestamp
Ideas & screen ID.”

Chapter 13 — Implementation & Road‑Mapping
Part III Methods & Tools
13.0 Why Implementation Matters
A validated prototype is only a promissory note until real users adopt it. Implementation bridges
the “innovation‑delivery gap,” translating workshop momentum into shipped value. This stage
aligns resources, clarifies ownership, and plots the shortest viable path to measurable impact.
13.1 From Prototype to Pilot — Decision Matrix
Criterion Green Light Yellow Red Light
User Value SUS ≥ 75, NPS ≥ +30 Mixed feedback Clear rejection / low usage
Feasibility Tech ready in Moderate refactor Requires new platform

Chapter 14 — Reflection & Learning
Part III Methods & Tools
14.0 Opening Story
“Our biggest insight came after the applause.”
At a Nairobi CreateX showcase, Team AgroLink wowed judges with an AI produce‑pricing
prototype. But during the debrief circle, a quiet farmer noted, “Prices shift hourly; weekly SMS isn’t
enough.” The team pivoted to real‑time USSD alerts and later doubled pilot adoption. The moment
illustrates a core CreateX belief: learning peaks after the ‘finish line’—if we make space for it.
14.1 Why Reflection?
● Double‑Loop Learning (Argyris): revisit governing assumptions, not just actions.
● Knowledge Transfer (NASA post‑mortems): reduces repeat errors across teams.
● Creative Confidence Flywheel (Kelley): reflection consolidates mastery experiences,
fueling confidence.
14.2 After‑Action Review (AAR)
Section Details

Chapter 15 — Scoping & Logistics
Part IV Planning & Running a CreateX Workshop
15.0 Opening Story
“The workshop is where?”
When CreateX facilitator Nadia Patel arrived at a Kuala Lumpur coworking space, she found half
her participants stuck in traffic and the air‑con broken. Quick pivot: she opened a parallel Zoom
room, couriered snack vouchers, and rearranged seats under ceiling fans. The session started
20 minutes late—yet finished on time, with record AoCC scores. The lesson: great facilitation
begins days before the first sticky note—in scoping and logistics.
15.1 Why Scoping & Logistics?
● Right‑Size Challenge avoids vague “boil‑the‑ocean” briefs.
● Operational Readiness ensures tools, space, and people mesh smoothly.
● Stakeholder Alignment prevents last‑minute derailers.
Skipping this phase multiplies downstream churn, burns credibility, and bloats budgets.

Chapter 16 — Agenda Design
Part IV Planning & Running a CreateX Workshop
16.0 Opening Story
“The clock is a creative tool.”
At a Bogotá educators’ workshop, facilitator Diego Marín noticed energy sagging after lunch. He
swapped the next lecture with a five‑minute “AI graffiti” challenge—participants shouted prompts
while Midjourney painted hilarious mash‑ups in real time. Laughter spiked, and the group rocketed
into prototyping. Diego’s agile agenda tweak saved the day and cemented a CreateX principle:
design the clock as carefully as the canvas.
16.1 Agenda Design Goals
1. Energy Arc — Alternate high‑cognitive and reflective moments to avoid fatigue.
107

--- Page 108 ---
2. Progressive Fidelity — Each block outputs an artifact feeding the next.
3. Inclusive Timing — Respect global time zones, prayer breaks, caregiving windows.
4. AI “Assist Blocks” — Strategic moments where automation accelerates flow.

Chapter 17 — Facilitation Skills
Part IV Planning & Running a CreateX Workshop
17.0 Facilitator as Guide · Guru · Guardrail
A CreateX facilitator juggles three fluid roles:
Role Core Question Hallmark Behaviours
Guide “Where do we go next?” Asks catalytic questions, invites participation,
redirects energy.
Guru “What knowledge unlocks Injects concise expertise or demo, never
the block?” monologues.
Guardrail “How do we stay on track Manages time boxes, maintains psychological
and safe?” safety, enforces ethics.
Skilful facilitation is knowing when to switch hats—and when to stay silent.
17.1 Core Communication Micro‑Skills

Chapter 19 — Troubleshooting in Real Time
Part IV Planning & Running a CreateX Workshop
19.0 Why a Troubleshooting Playbook?
Even the best‑scoped, well‑timed workshop will hit bumps: tech glitches, energy crashes,
conflict spikes. Real‑time troubleshooting keeps momentum, trust, and creative confidence
intact. A prepared facilitator diagnoses fast, applies the right fix, and turns hiccups into learning
moments.
19.1 Rapid Diagnosis Grid
126

--- Page 127 ---
Symptom Likely Root Cause First Probe Question
Awkward Silence Cognitive overload, unclear “What part of the task feels
ask, low safety unclear?”
Energy Dip (yawns, Long cognitive stretch, low “Let’s rate energy 1‑5—where are
phones) blood sugar we?”
Tech Freeze (platform Bandwidth, browser “Who else sees the error?”
crash) compatibility
Dominating Voice Power dynamics, enthusiasm “Can we hear from someone who
burst hasn’t spoken yet?”
Scope Spiral Brief too broad, stakeholder “Which success metric does this
jumps in idea serve?”
