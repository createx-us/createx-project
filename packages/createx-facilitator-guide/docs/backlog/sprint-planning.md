### Sprint Risks and Mitigation

#### Risk 1: API Complexity

**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Mitigation**: Start API development early, create prototype endpoints first

#### Risk 2: Real-time Features Complexity
**Risk**: WebSocket implementation for timers may face technical challenges  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Mitigation**: Research and spike WebSocket solutions, have polling fallback

#### Risk 3: Performance with Large Assessments
**Risk**: Large assessments may cause performance issues  
**Probability**: Low  
**Impact**: High  
**Mitigation**: Implement pagination and lazy loading, performance testing
