Lacking tools, he sculpted with salvaged wood and clay, transforming constraint into catalyst. His story reminds us that creativity isn't a luxury of circumstance but a mindset that reframes limitation as invitation.\n\n**Reflection:** Think of a time when limitations sparked your creativity. How did constraints actually help rather than hinder your creative process?"

(Guilford, 1950; Runco, 2004)\n\n### Neuroscience Perspective\nfMRI studies link creative insight incubation to dynamic switching between the default mode network (daydreaming) and executive control networks (evaluation).\n\n### Anthropological Perspective\nCreativity is a social contract: Igbo \"nkà,\" Japanese \"monozukuri,\" and Silicon Valley \"innovation\" celebrate different outputs, norms, and success criteria.\n\n**Key Insight:** Creativity = Novelty × Utility (relative to context)."
