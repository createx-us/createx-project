At its simplest, creativity is the capacity to generate ideas, artifacts, or actions that are
simultaneously novel and appropriate within a given context. Each discipline, however, colors
the edges of that definition:
Lens Core Insight
Psychology Creativity blends divergent thinking (fluency, flexibility, originality,
elaboration) with convergent judgment to select promising options.
(Guilford, 1950; Runco, 2004)
Neuroscience fMRI studies link creative idea incubation to dynamic switching
between the default‑mode network (daydreaming) and executive
control network (evaluation).
Anthropology Creativity is a social contract: Igbo “nkà,” Japanese “monozukuri,”
and Silicon Valley “innovation” valorize different outputs, norms, and
success criteria.
Reflection Prompt ①
Recall a moment when you produced something new and useful. Which of the three lenses above
best explains why it “worked”? Jot down thoughts before moving on.

1.3 Individual vs. Collective Creativity
Individual insight can feel intoxicating, yet research shows cognitive diversity—differences in
knowledge, heuristics, and perspectives—produces more adaptive solutions.

1.4 The Role of AI in Human Creativity

Large‑language models, generative imagery, and analytic copilots expand our ideational
bandwidth but do not replace human judgment. Three complementarity modes:
1. Spark: LLMs supply provocative starting points when the team is “stuck.”
2. Stretch: AI simulations expose hidden edge cases and inspire bolder prototypes.
3. Sharpen: Realtime critique (readability scores, bias flags) accelerates refinement.
Ethics Watch: Creators remain accountable for truthfulness, bias mitigation, and contextual
appropriateness of AI‑assisted content.
1.5 Putting It into Practice
1. Divergence Drill – Set a timer for 5 minutes and list as many uses as possible for a
coffee mug. Stop at 30 seconds left and ask ChatGPT for five additional, unexpected
uses. Observe overlaps and surprises.
2. Constraint Remix – Take an existing product idea and force‑fit a new constraint (e.g.,
“must be zero‑waste”). Note how the idea shifts.
3. Collective Upgrade – Share your idea in a group, then run a “1‑2‑4‑All” session to
evolve it. Compare solo vs. collective output.
1.6 Key Takeaways
● Creativity = Novelty × Usefulness relative to context.
● Myths obscure the incremental, democratized nature of creative work.
● Cognitive diversity and structured collaboration outperform lone‑genius models.
● AI is a lever for sparking, stretching, and sharpening ideas—never a shortcut around
human empathy and ethics.
