# Chapter 9: Framing & Opportunity Prioritization

**Track:** Design Process  
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Prerequisites:** Chapter 8

## Learning Objectives

- Master point-of-view statements and problem framing techniques
- Apply structured prioritization frameworks (RICE, ICE, Impact/Effort)
- Use AI-driven prioritization tools effectively
- Create opportunity canvases for strategic decision-making
- Avoid common framing and prioritization pitfalls

## Overview

A brilliant prototype built on a poorly framed problem is lipstick on a pig. Framing distills insights into focused challenge statements; prioritization ensures limited resources chase the highest-value opportunities. Together they act as the hinge between Define and Develop.

## 9.0 Why Framing Matters

### The Foundation for Great Solutions

**Clear Framing:**
- **Prevents Solution Drift**: Keeps teams focused on the real problem
- **Aligns Stakeholders**: Creates shared understanding of the challenge  
- **Guides Resource Allocation**: Ensures effort goes to highest-impact areas
- **Enables Measurement**: Provides clear success criteria

**Poor Framing Consequences:**
- Building solutions for symptoms, not root causes
- Team confusion and competing priorities
- Wasted resources on low-impact initiatives
- Difficulty measuring success

### The Prioritization Imperative

**Why Prioritize:**
- Limited time and resources
- Multiple competing opportunities
- Need for stakeholder buy-in
- Risk management requirements

## 9.1 Point‑of‑View (POV) Statement

### Formula & Example

**Formula**: [User] needs a way to [verb need] because [surprising insight]

**Example**: "Adjunct professors need a way to keep lesson files synced because campus Wi-Fi cuts out every 15 minutes."

### Method Card

| **Section** | **Details** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Translate empathy into a crisp problem frame. |
| **When to Use** | After insight statements; before HMW brainstorming. |
| **Step-by-Step** | 1) Draft solo, 2) Pair-share, 3) Refine wording, 4) Quick vote for resonance. |
| **AI Prompt Ideas** | "Rewrite this insight into a POV statement, keep < 25 words, highlight causality." |
| **Pitfalls** | Cramming solutions ("…need a Dropbox-like app"). |
| **Template** | createx.us/toolkit/pov-canvas |

### POV Quality Checklist

**Strong POVs:**
- [ ] Specific user segment identified
- [ ] Action-oriented need (verb-based)
- [ ] Surprising or counterintuitive insight
- [ ] Grounded in research evidence
- [ ] Under 25 words for clarity

**Weak POVs:**
- Generic users ("people need...")
- Solution-embedded language
- Obvious or unsupported insights
- Too long or complex

## 9.2 Problem Statement Canvas (5Qs)

### The Five Essential Questions

| **Q** | **Guiding Prompt** |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Who** | Which user segment suffers most? |
| **What** | Observable pain or unmet aspiration? |
| **Where** | Context or channel where issue arises? |
| **Why Now** | Trigger or urgency factor? |
| **Win** | Success metric if solved? |

### Process

**Fill as a group, then sanity-check against research evidence.**

**Time Allocation:**
- 5 minutes per question (25 minutes total)
- 10 minutes for evidence validation
- 10 minutes for refinement and consensus

## 9.3 Opportunity Canvas (Lean Variant)

### Canvas Structure

| **Block** | **Notes** |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Problem** | Core user pain point |
| **Existing Alternatives** | Current workarounds and solutions |
| **Proposed Solution Ideas** | Initial concept directions |
| **User Benefits** | Value for end users |
| **Business Benefits** | Organizational value |
| **Key Metrics** | Success measurement |
| **Risks & Assumptions** | What could go wrong |

**AI Assist**: "From these POV statements, auto-populate a draft Opportunity Canvas—flag blank blocks."

### Canvas Completion Tips

**Evidence-Based**: Ground each block in research data
**Specific**: Avoid generic statements
**Measurable**: Include quantifiable metrics where possible
**Balanced**: Consider both user and business value

## 9.4 Framing Sprint (40 minutes)

### Sprint Timeline

| **Minute** | **Activity** |
|------------|--------------|
| **0-5** | Recap top insights |
| **5-15** | Draft POV & Problem 5Qs in trios |
| **15-25** | Rotate canvases, peer critique |
| **25-35** | Group vote: top 3 frames |
| **35-40** | Assign framing owners for refinement |

### Sprint Facilitation Tips

- **Silent Work First**: Individual drafting before discussion
- **Rotation System**: Fresh eyes on each frame
- **Time Pressure**: Prevents perfectionism
- **Clear Ownership**: Assign specific people to refine winners

## 9.5 Impact × Effort 2 × 2 Revisit

### Quadrant Strategy

| **Quadrant** | **Strategy** |
|--------------|--------------|
| **High Impact / Low Effort** | Quick Wins — build ASAP |
| **High Impact / High Effort** | Transformational Bets — seek sponsorship |
| **Low Impact / Low Effort** | Fill-Ins — delegate or batch |
| **Low Impact / High Effort** | Waste — discard |

**Tip**: Score impact relative to AoCC metric; effort in person-days.

### Scoring Guidelines

**Impact (1-5):**
- 1 = Minimal user/business value
- 3 = Moderate improvement
- 5 = Transformational change

**Effort (1-5):**
- 1 = 1-2 person-days
- 3 = 1-2 person-weeks  
- 5 = 1-2 person-months

## 9.6 RICE Scoring (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)

### RICE Framework

| **Factor** | **How to Estimate** |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Reach** | # users affected per time-box |
| **Impact** | 1 = minimal, 3 = medium, 5 = massive |
| **Confidence** | % certainty in estimates |
| **Effort** | Person-weeks (lower = better) |

**RICE = (Re × I × C) / E — highest score wins.**

**AI Prompt**: "Generate RICE table for these five opportunities; ask for missing inputs."

### RICE Application Process

1. **List Opportunities**: All concepts under consideration
2. **Estimate Reach**: Use existing data or educated guesses
3. **Score Impact**: Team consensus on 1-5 scale
4. **Assess Confidence**: Honest evaluation of uncertainty
5. **Estimate Effort**: Break down into specific tasks
6. **Calculate & Rank**: Let the math guide decisions

## 9.7 ICE, WSJF & Kano Quick Picks

### Alternative Frameworks

| **Model** | **Best For** | **One-Liner** |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **ICE** (Impact × Confidence / Effort) | Early-stage startups | Lower cognitive load than RICE |
| **WSJF** (Cost of Delay / Job Size) | Agile program increments | Quantifies delivery economics |
| **Kano** | Feature roadmap | Maps satisfiers, delighters, must-haves |

**Use one quantitative model plus a visual matrix to triangulate.**

### Framework Selection Guide

**Choose ICE when:**
- Small team with limited data
- Quick decisions needed
- Early-stage concepts

**Choose RICE when:**
- Larger team with good data
- Detailed analysis needed
- Mature product/service

**Choose WSJF when:**
- Agile development context
- Clear delivery timelines
- Cost of delay is measurable

## 9.8 AI‑Driven Prioritization Flow

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Import opportunity list + metrics**
2. **GPT suggests missing data** → team validates
3. **Auto-calculate RICE & ICE**
4. **Bubble chart outputs** to BoardX 2×2
5. **Human debate & finalize** top 3 bets

**Ethics Note**: Never let AI pick alone; it lacks context on strategy, values, or politics.

### AI Integration Best Practices

**What AI Does Well:**
- Calculations and data processing
- Identifying missing information
- Generating visualization options
- Suggesting additional factors to consider

**What Humans Must Do:**
- Validate assumptions and estimates
- Consider strategic context
- Make final decisions
- Account for political and cultural factors

## 9.9 Common Pitfalls & Fixes

| **Pitfall** | **Fix** |
|-------------|---------|
| **Data Guess-timation** | Mark low confidence scores; revisit after pilot metrics |
| **Group Sway (HiPPO)** | Blind voting before discussion; reveal scores later |
| **Over-Index on Business** | Balance user and mission impact weights |

### Additional Pitfalls

**Analysis Paralysis**: Set time limits for scoring discussions
**False Precision**: Use ranges instead of exact numbers when uncertain
**Ignoring Context**: Consider organizational capacity and strategic fit
**One-Size-Fits-All**: Adapt frameworks to your specific context

## 9.10 Key Takeaways

- **Crystal-clear framing prevents solution drift and aligns stakeholders**
- **Combine qualitative canvases (POV, Problem 5Qs) with quantitative models (RICE)** for balanced decisions
- **AI accelerates canvas prep and scoring but humans arbitrate nuance**
- **Document rationale**; future teams will revisit why paths were chosen

### Success Factors

1. **Ground in Evidence**: Base all framing on research insights
2. **Balance Perspectives**: Consider user, business, and technical factors
3. **Stay Transparent**: Document reasoning for future reference
4. **Remain Flexible**: Be willing to reframe as you learn more
5. **Focus Resources**: Prioritize ruthlessly to maximize impact
