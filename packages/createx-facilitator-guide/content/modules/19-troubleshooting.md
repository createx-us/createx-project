## Overview

Troubleshooting in Real Time provides systematic approaches for handling the inevitable disruptions, technical issues, and group dynamics challenges that arise during workshops while maintaining momentum and psychological safety.

## 19.0 Why a Troubleshooting Playbook?

Even the best-scoped, well-timed workshop will hit bumps: tech glitches, energy crashes, conflict spikes. Real-time troubleshooting keeps momentum, trust, and creative confidence intact. A prepared facilitator diagnoses fast, applies the right fix, and turns hiccups into learning moments.

## 19.1 Rapid Diagnosis Grid

| Symptom | Likely Root Cause | First Probe Question |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Awkward Silence** | Cognitive overload, unclear ask, low safety | "What part of the task feels unclear?" |
| **Energy Dip (yawns, phones)** | Long cognitive stretch, low blood sugar | "Let's rate energy 1-5—where are we?" |
| **Tech Freeze (platform crash)** | Bandwidth, browser compatibility | "Who else sees the error?" |
| **Dominating Voice** | Power dynamics, enthusiasm burst | "Can we hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet?" |
| **Scope Spiral** | Brief too broad, stakeholder jumps in | "Which success metric does this idea serve?" |

**Tip:** State the observation neutrally ("I'm noticing silence…") before intervening.

## 19.2 Troubleshooting Tactics Library

| Category | Tactic | Use When | How-To |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Energy** | Lightning Stretch | Post-lunch slump | 90-second guided stretch + upbeat track |
| | AI Graffiti | Idea stagnation | Shout prompts → Midjourney live generation |
| **Clarity** | Re-Demo | Task confusion | Facilitator models task for 60 sec |
| | Stack Questions | Multiple clarifications | Park Qs on board, answer in batch |
| **Time** | Time-Box Cut | Overrun block | Announce "2-min wrap-up," move to next |
| | Flex Buffer Use | Major overrun | Consume pre-planned 10% slack |
| **Conflict** | Yes-And Round | Idea killing | Each speaks starting with "Yes-and…" |
| | Data Recall | Opinion deadlock | Pull original user quote or metric |
| **Tech** | Link Swap | BoardX lag | Jump to backup BoardX/Figma link |
| | Offline Shift | Wi-Fi down | Paper stickies + phone photos |

## 19.3 Real-Time AI Rescue Moves

| Scenario | AI Prompt | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Lost Summary** | "Summarize last 30 chat lines into 5 bullets." | Fast recap |
| **Blank Ideas** | "Generate 10 playful metaphors for {theme}." | Spark novelty |
| **Scope Check** | "Which concept aligns best with KPI {X}? Output score 1-5." | Objective anchor |
| **Sentiment Check** | "Analyze chat for frustration words > 0.6 polarity." | Flag hidden tension |

**Guardrail:** Announce AI use; show summary to group for validation.

## 19.4 The Five-Step Recovery Script ("CALMS")

| Step | Action | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **C — Context** | Name issue neutrally | "Our energy dipped after 90 min." |
| **A — Acknowledge** | Validate feeling | "That's totally normal." |
| **L — Leverage** | Bring objective cue | "Survey shows avg energy = 2.7/5." |
| **M — Move** | Apply tactic | "Let's do a 2-min sketch race." |
| **S — Seal** | Reflect outcome | "Energy now 4/5—great, onward." |

## 19.5 Role Escalation Protocol

| Level | Trigger | Escalation |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **Facilitator Fix** | Minor confusion | Apply tactic from library |
| **Co-Facilitator Assist** | Persistent derailing voice | Swap facilitator; co-fac mediates |
| **Sponsor Ping** | Scope conflict w/ business reality | 5-min sponsor huddle |
| **Workshop Pause** | Ethical / safety breach | Halt session; code-of-conduct response |
| **Cancel / Reschedule** | Platform outage > 30 min, critical stakeholder absent | Invoke contingency date |

## 19.6 Tech Failsafe Kit

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Portable 4G/5G hotspot** | Internet backup |
| **HDMI dongles + adapters** | Projector mismatch |
| **Printed templates (20 sets)** | Canvas offline pivot |
| **Physical timer** | Digital clock crash |
| **Spare laptop + power bank** | Hardware failure |

## 19.7 Psychological Safety First-Aid

| Signal | Immediate Action |
|--------|------------------|
| **Tearful participant** | Offer break, private check-in |
| **Heated argument** | Call 2-min pause; separate parties |
| **Micro-aggression spotted** | Address publicly: restate norm, redirect |
| **Fatigue overwhelm** | Offer opt-out or silent contribution channel |

## 19.8 Case-Based Drills (Run with Facil Team)

1. **Scenario:** Zoom drops audio intermittently
   - **Drill:** Switch to phone bridge within 3 min

2. **Scenario:** Sponsor declares mid-session: "We just need a marketing slogan."
   - **Drill:** Use CALMS to re-scope or park request

3. **Scenario:** AI tool outputs biased persona
   - **Drill:** Bias scan, rewrite live, discuss learning moment

## 19.9 Common Pitfalls & Fixes

| Pitfall | Consequence | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Panic Reaction** | Facilitator loses authority | Follow CALMS script; breathe |
| **Over-Facilitating** | Choke organic dialogue | Apply "10-second wait" after asking questions |
| **Ignoring Tech Signs** | Latency worsens | Announce switch early; don't hope |
| **Blame Game** | Team morale drops | Use "process, not person" language |

## Key Takeaways

- **Prepared tactics + calm mindset = resilient facilitation**
- **Diagnose via symptom → root cause → probe** before acting
- **Use AI rescue moves sparingly and transparently**
- **Apply CALMS framework** to surface, address, and close any disruption
- **Psychological safety overrides agenda**; always triage human needs first

## Reflection Questions

1. How will you build your confidence in real-time diagnosis and intervention without over-facilitating?
2. What specific tech failsafe preparations are most critical for your workshop environments?
3. How can you practice the CALMS framework in low-stakes situations to build muscle memory?
