# Chapter 16: Agenda Design

**Track:** Workshop Design  
**Duration:** 50 min  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Prerequisites:** Chapter 15

## Learning Objectives

- Master agenda design principles and energy arc management
- Apply structured workshop templates for different timeframes
- Understand AI-assisted facilitation block integration
- Implement flexible agenda modification techniques

## Overview

Agenda Design is the art of crafting time-based experiences that guide participants through productive creative processes. This module covers structured templates, energy management, and adaptive approaches for different contexts and constraints.

## 16.0 Opening Story

"The clock is a creative tool."

At a Bogotá educators' workshop, facilitator Diego Marín noticed energy sagging after lunch. He swapped the next lecture with a five-minute "AI graffiti" challenge—participants shouted prompts while Midjourney painted hilarious mash-ups in real time. Laughter spiked, and the group rocketed into prototyping. Diego's agile agenda tweak saved the day and cemented a CreateX principle: design the clock as carefully as the canvas.

## 16.1 Agenda Design Goals

1. **Energy Arc** — Alternate high-cognitive and reflective moments to avoid fatigue
2. **Progressive Fidelity** — Each block outputs an artifact feeding the next
3. **Inclusive Timing** — Respect global time zones, prayer breaks, caregiving windows
4. **AI "Assist Blocks"** — Strategic moments where automation accelerates flow

## 16.3 Flagship 1-Day Agenda (In-Person or Hybrid)

| Phase | Block | Duration | Energy | Note |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|------|
| **AM** | Welcome & Team Canvas | 30 min | High-energy ice-break |
| | Field Interviews OR Playback Videos | 60 min | Empathy immersion |
| | Affinity + Insight | 60 min | Peak cognitive load |
| | HMW Generation | 30 min | Divergent burst |
| **Lunch** | Lightning Talk (guest) | 45 min | Passive intake |
| **Early PM** | Brainwriting + Crazy 8s | 60 min | Fast action |
| | AI Co-Ideation Blitz | 30 min | Novelty spark |
| | Dot-Vote & Concept Posters | 30 min | Convergence |
| **Late PM** | Paper Prototype Build | 60 min | Hands-on flow |
| | Think-Aloud Tests × 3 | 45 min | User focus |
| | Reflection & AoCC Log | 20 min | Downshift |
| **Evening** | Optional Social Hour | — | Bonding |

## 16.4 Two-Day Deep-Dive Agenda (Distributed Teams)

| Day | Focus | Core Outputs |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| **Day 1** (4 × 90 min sprints) | Discover → Define | Research capture, Insight themes, POVs, HMW list |
| **Day 2** (4 × 90 min sprints) | Develop → Deliver | Idea portfolio, Prototype, Test results, Pilot canvas |

**Built-in 12-hour overnight "slow-hunch" gap between diamonds.**

## 16.5 Energy & Break Planning

| Clock Zone | Typical Dip | Counter-Move |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **11:00** | Pre-lunch hunger | Stand-up improv ("Yes-And Chain") |
| **14:00** | Post-meal slump | 5-min cardio burst + upbeat playlist |
| **16:30** | Cognitive fatigue | Silent reflection / journaling |

**Hydration Stations:** ≥ 1 per 10 participants; plain + electrolytes.

## 16.6 AI "Assist Block" Catalog

| Stage | Duration | Tool | Objective |
|-------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Research Digest** | 5 min | GPT Digest | Auto-summary of transcripts |
| **Ideation Booster** | 10 min | ChatGPT / Gemini | 20 wildcard concepts |
| **Copy Polish** | 5 min | GrammarlyGO | Tighten poster text |
| **Retro Synth** | 5 min | GPT Insight | Draft recap email |

## 16.7 Agenda Modifiers

| Constraint | Adjustment |
|------------|------------|
| **Remote-Only Global** | Split 1-day agenda into two 3-hour blocks across time zones; asynchronous affinity via BoardX |
| **Executive Audience** | Front-load business framing; shorten creative warm-ups; add ROI checkpoint after Concept Posters |
| **K-12 Classroom** | 45-min class periods; use gamified timers; more physical prototyping |

## 16.8 Run-Sheet & Roles

| Minute Mark | Action | Owner |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| **-30** | Set up room / Zoom | Tech Producer |
| **-10** | Slide deck check | Facilitator |
| **00** | Start recording | Remote Champion |
| **30** | Time-box reminder ping | Time-Keeper |
| **...** | ... | ... |

**Template:** createx.us/toolkit/run-sheet

## 16.9 Common Pitfalls & Fixes

| Pitfall | Warning Sign | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Agenda Overstuffed** | Constant overruns | Remove 15%; protect breaks |
| **Flat Energy** | Monotone voices | Inject improv or music |
| **AI Demo Fail** | Tool latency | Offline backup prompt examples |
| **Time-Zone Exclusion** | Remote team silent | Rotate agenda start times; record sessions |

## Key Takeaways

- **Agenda is storytelling with minutes**—shape an energy arc
- **Balance divergent and convergent blocks**, with breaks as neural reset points
- **Purposeful AI assist blocks** can shave 20–40% off mechanical tasks
- **Always prepare Plan B** slides and offline activities—flex is mastery
