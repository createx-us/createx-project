## Overview

Building Your Personal Facilitation Brand transforms individual competence into visible expertise, creating opportunities for greater impact, higher-tier engagements, and leadership in the design thinking community.

## 26.0 Opening Story

"People hired me before they hired CreateX."

In 2023, facilitator Marco Nguyen began posting 60-second LinkedIn recaps after every workshop—highlight reels, top insights, and a single photo of sticky-note chaos. Within six months he was invited to speak at three conferences and tripled his paid engagements. Marco's takeaway: visibility amplifies competence; a clear personal brand pulls opportunities toward you.

## 26.1 Why a Personal Brand?

- **Trust Accelerator** — Clients book humans, not toolkits
- **Opportunity Magnet** — Speaking, authorship, higher-tier gigs
- **Impact Multiplier** — Shared stories inspire others to adopt design thinking + AI ethics
- **Career Resilience** — A portable reputation transcends job titles and geographies

## 26.2 Brand Building Blocks (4 C's)

| Component | Guiding Questions | Quick Exercise |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Clarity** | What 3 words describe your facilitation super-power? | Ask 5 peers, collect adjectives |
| **Consistency** | Does your messaging & visual style stay coherent across channels? | Audit last 10 posts; note palette & tone |
| **Credibility** | What proof-points (case studies, metrics) back your claims? | Draft 3-bullet "impact snapshot" |
| **Community** | Where do your peers & prospects already gather? | Map top 3 platforms (LinkedIn, Discord, local meetup) |

## 26.3 Signature Content Formats

| Format | Cadence | Tips |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Workshop Recap Carousel (LinkedIn)** | 48 h post-event | 5 slides max: WHY–HOW–WOW–NEXT–CALL |
| **Method Explainer Thread (X/Twitter)** | Weekly | 280-char snippets + diagram GIF |
| **AI Prompt Walkthrough Video (YouTube/IG Reels)** | Monthly | < 90 s; show result before steps |
| **Case Study Blog (Medium or GhostCMS)** | Quarterly | 1,200–1,500 w · KPI table · download link |
| **Live AMA (Discord/Spaces)** | Ad-hoc | Collect Qs in advance; reuse clip highlights |

**AI Assist:** Use GPT-rewrite to tailor the same core insight to each channel's voice limit.

## 26.4 Story Bank System

1. **Capture** — Immediately after workshop, record a 2-min voice memo ("What surprised me?")
2. **Tag** — Label memo with hashtags (#conflict #airescue #wowmetric)
3. **Archive** — Store in Notion DB with date, client, theme
4. **Transform** — At week's end pick 1 memo → convert into LinkedIn carousel
5. **Recycle** — Quarterly bundle related stories into conference talk deck

## 26.5 Visual Identity Starter Kit

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Color Palette** | 2 primaries + 1 accent (align with CreateX if desired) |
| **Typography** | Readable sans-serif for body; distinctive heading font |
| **Logo / Mark** | Simple monogram / symbol; optional (badge overlay) |
| **Imagery** | Real workshop photos > stock; consistent filter or LUT |
| **Icon Set** | Use Tabler Icons or Feather for consistency in slides |

**Tool:** Canva Brand Kit or Figma design system page.

## 26.7 Networking Flywheel

```
Post content ➜ Trigger discussion ➜ DM follow-up ➜
Virtual coffee ➜ Offer micro-help (template/prompt) ➜
