# Chapter 15: Scoping & Logistics

**Track:** Workshop Design  
**Duration:** 45 min  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Prerequisites:** Chapter 14

## Learning Objectives

- Master challenge framing and participant selection techniques
- Apply systematic workshop planning and risk management
- Understand budget planning and timeline management
- Implement hybrid facilitation best practices

## Overview

Scoping & Logistics forms the foundation of successful design thinking workshops. This module covers comprehensive planning approaches, from challenge definition to technical setup, ensuring operational readiness for effective facilitation.

## 15.0 Opening Story

"The workshop is where?"

When CreateX facilitator Nadia Patel arrived at a Kuala Lumpur coworking space, she found half her participants stuck in traffic and the air-con broken. Quick pivot: she opened a parallel Zoom room, couriered snack vouchers, and rearranged seats under ceiling fans. The session started 20 minutes late—yet finished on time, with record AoCC scores. The lesson: great facilitation begins days before the first sticky note—in scoping and logistics.

## 15.1 Why Scoping & Logistics?

**Core Benefits:**
- **Right-Size Challenge** avoids vague "boil-the-ocean" briefs
- **Operational Readiness** ensures tools, space, and people mesh smoothly
- **Stakeholder Alignment** prevents last-minute derailers

Skipping this phase multiplies downstream churn, burns credibility, and bloats budgets.

## 15.2 Challenge Framing Checklist

| Item | Guiding Prompt | Owner |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **Problem Statement** | Does it name a user, need, and context? | Sponsor |
| **Success Metrics** | At least one quantitative and one qualitative KPI? | PO |
| **Constraints** | Budget, tech stack, policy rules explicit? | Legal/IT |
| **Non-Goals** | What's out of scope? | Facilitator |
| **Why Now** | Urgency clear? | Sponsor |

## 15.3 Participant Selection Matrix

| Role | Ideal % | Rationale |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Core Users / Beneficiaries** | 25–35% | Ground empathy in reality |
| **Domain Experts** | 10–15% | Provide constraints & depth |
| **Decision-Makers** | 10% | Fast-track adoption |
| **Makers (Design, Dev)** | 20–30% | Prototype muscle |
| **Wild Cards (diverse POVs)** | 10–15% | Cognitive diversity |

**Team Size Sweet Spot:** 10–30 total. More = unwieldy, less = limited idea pool.

## 15.4 Environment & Tooling

| Dimension | In-Person | Virtual / Hybrid |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Space** | ≥ 1.5 m² per person, movable walls, daylight ideal | Quiet rooms, stable 10 Mbps per attendee |
| **Surfaces** | Whiteboard ≥ 7 m, sticky-friendly | Digital canvas (BoardX, BoardX) set up |
| **Audio** | Wireless mic if > 20 people | Quality headsets; echo-cancellation enabled |
| **Recording** | HD cam on tripod | Screen-record + cloud transcription |
| **Materials** | Post-its (3 colors), markers, timer, camera | Template links, breakout rooms pre-named |

## 15.5 Budget Template (USD)

| Category | % Typical | Note |
|----------|-----------|------|
| **Facilitation Fees** | 45% | Incl. prep & synthesis |
| **Venue / Platform** | 15% | Coworking day-rate or Zoom Pro |
| **Materials / Tools** | 8% | Post-its, prototyping kits, AI credits |
| **Catering / Snacks** | 12% | Energy maintenance |
| **Travel / Lodging** | 10% | If multi-site |
| **Contingency** | 10% | Unforeseen |

**Rule:** Set aside 15% of total for AI tool usage & cloud storage, adjust with org's existing licenses.

## 15.6 Timeline Back-Plan (T-Minus)

| T-Date | Milestone |
|--------|-----------|
| **T-30 d** | Finalize challenge brief + budget |
| **T-21 d** | Secure venue / platform; send Save-the-Date |
| **T-14 d** | Confirm participants; dispatch pre-reads & CCS-10 survey |
| **T-10 d** | Tech rehearsal; bias scan AI tools |
| **T-7 d** | Materials order / template lock |
| **T-2 d** | Agenda dry-run; backup internet/power plan |
| **T-0** | Workshop day |
| **T+1 d** | Immediate AAR + AoCC log |
| **T+7 d** | Deliver synthesis pack |

## 15.7 Risk & Contingency Grid

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Key stakeholder no-show** | Med | High | Record kickoff video; assign proxy decision-maker |
| **Tech failure (platform outage)** | Low | High | Backup platform link + offline worksheets |
| **Visa / Travel delay** | Low | Med | Hybrid join option; ship kits |
| **Participant drop-offs** | Med | Med | Over-invite by 15%; standby list |
| **Data privacy concern** | Med | High | NDAs; masked transcripts |

## 15.8 Legal & Ethical Prep

1. **Consent Forms** — Cover recording, AI processing, and publication rights
2. **Data Handling SOP** — Retention period, storage encryption, access control
3. **Accessibility Checklist** — WCAG 2.2 AA digital assets; wheelchair access, captioning

## 15.9 Kickoff Communication Pack

| Asset | Content | Channel | When |
|-------|---------|---------|------|
| **Email 1** | Welcome + brief + logistics | Email | T-14 d |
| **Slack/Discord** | Channel invite + ice-breaker poll | Chat | T-10 d |
| **Calendar ICS** | Agenda blocks & Zoom link | Calendar | T-10 d |
