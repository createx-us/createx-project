- **Christopher Alexander** (1977): "A Pattern Language" - Systematic design approach

### Stanford Era (1980s-1990s)
**David Kelley** and **Rolf Faste** at Stanford d.school formalized design thinking as teachable methodology:

- Human-centered approach
- Emphasis on empathy and user research
- Integration of multidisciplinary teams
- Prototype-driven iteration

### IDEO Popularization (1990s-2000s)
**Tim Brown** and **Tom Kelley** brought design thinking to business mainstream:

- Shared ownership of problems and solutions
- Building on collective intelligence
- Democratic participation in creative process

### 3. Experimental Mindset

## 2.5 Facilitating Design Thinking

### Creating the Right Environment

**Physical Space:**
- Flexible, reconfigurable furniture
- Wall space for posting ideas
- Materials for prototyping readily available
- Natural light and comfortable temperature

**Psychological Space:**
- Ground rules for respectful collaboration
- Encouragement of wild ideas
- Defer judgment protocols
- Celebration of experimentation

### Managing the Process

**Time Management:**
- Clear timeboxing for each phase
- Balance between divergent and convergent thinking
- Built-in reflection and synthesis periods
- Flexibility to adapt based on group needs

**Energy Management:**
- Alternate between individual and group work
- Include movement and physical activity
- Monitor energy levels and adjust accordingly
- Use energizers and brain breaks

### Common Facilitation Challenges

**1. Jumping to Solutions**
- **Challenge:** Teams want to solve before understanding problem
- **Solution:** Enforce empathy and define phases before ideation
- **Prevention:** Set clear expectations about process adherence

**2. Perfectionism in Prototyping**
- **Challenge:** Spending too much time making prototypes beautiful
- **Solution:** Emphasize "good enough" for learning
- **Prevention:** Model low-fidelity prototyping yourself

**3. Fear of User Feedback**
- **Challenge:** Teams avoid testing because they fear negative feedback
- **Solution:** Frame feedback as learning opportunity
- **Prevention:** Share examples of valuable "negative" feedback
