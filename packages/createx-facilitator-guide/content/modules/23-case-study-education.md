| **2** | Field Research · AEIOU docs | GPT auto-theme homework |
| **3** | Affinity & Insight · HMW list | LLM cluster assist |
| **4** | Ideation Marathon (Brainwriting, Crazy 8s) | Gemini idea seeds |
| **5** | Prototype #1 (Paper + Figma) | Galileo prompt-to-UI tutorial |
| **6** | User Testing Round 1 · AAR | Sentiment dashboard |
| **7** | Mid-term Critique · Pivot / Persevere | GPT feedback digest |
| **8–13** | Repeat Diamond #2 (refined scope) | Ongoing AI pairing |
| **14** | Final Demo Day · Pilot Canvas & KPI board | Auto-subtitled highlight reels |

**All sessions delivered as 3-hour Friday labs; lectures pre-recorded (flipped model).**

## 23.3 Sample Team Outcome — "PeerPal"

| Category | Detail |
|----------|---------|
| **Problem** | Rising freshman anxiety, counseling backlog 3 weeks |
| **Solution** | Peer-support matching app → triage chatbot → warm hand-off |
| **Prototype** | Click-through Figma + Wizard-of-Oz GPT chat |
| **Pilot** | 60 volunteers, 4 weeks, 1,200 messages |
| **Metrics** | Avg wait for chat: 3 min vs 3 weeks; 92% helpful rating |
| **Next Step** | University innovation fund seed $25k (Jan 2026 launch) |

## 23.4 Creative Confidence & Skill Gains

| Metric | Pre-Course | Post-Midterm | Final | Δ |
|--------|------------|--------------|-------|---|
| **CCS-10 (avg)** | 5.8 | 7.3 | 8.2 | +2.4 |
| **AI Prompting Self-Efficacy¹ (1-10)** | 3.1 | — | 7.4 | +4.3 |
| **Team NPS** | — | +48 | +67 | — |

**¹ Custom mini-survey (3 items).**

**"I now treat AI like a sketch partner, not a vending machine."** — Design major

## 23.5 Assessment & Grading Schema

| Weight | Artifact | Rubric Key |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **25%** | Research Insight Report | Depth, evidence, empathy |
| **25%** | Prototype & Test Cycles | Fidelity matched to question, learning loops |
| **20%** | Reflection Journals (weekly) | Honesty, insight, growth mindset |
| **15%** | Peer Evaluation | Contribution, collaboration |
| **15%** | Final Demo & Pilot Plan | Storytelling, feasibility, KPI clarity |

**Rubric aligned with ABET soft-skill outcomes (teamwork, communication, ethics).**

## 23.6 Faculty & Stakeholder Feedback

| Quote | Stakeholder |
|-------|-------------|
| **"This studio produced the most market-ready ideas I've seen in 20 years."** | TechU Entrepreneurship Director |
| **"Students who took the course perform better in capstone collaboration."** | CS Dept Chair |
| **"The AI ethics checklist became a template for our whole innovation office."** | University Counsel |

## 23.7 Lessons Learned & Adjustments

| Dimension | Insight | Next Iteration |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Time-Zone Inclusion (Intl students)** | Late-night Friday lab for some | Offer alt Tuesday AM section |
| **Tool Fatigue** | Students toggled 5 apps | Consolidate into BoardX + Figma only |
| **AI Over-reliance** | Early Shallow ideation in Week 2 | Mandate "manual first, AI second" rule |

## 23.8 Replication Guide

1. **Secure Real-World Briefs** — Partner with campus ops or local NGOs for authentic challenges
2. **Flip Lectures** — Free studio time for hands-on sprints
3. **Leverage Peer Teaching** — Student "method leads" run warm-ups, reducing facilitator load
4. **Integrate Ethics Early** — Dedicated Week 2 module on AI bias & privacy builds critical lens
