## 21.0 Snapshot

| Item | Detail |
|------|---------|
| **Client** | Acme Logistics — Fortune 500 supply-chain operator |
| **Location / Format** | Montréal HQ · 4-day hybrid sprint (onsite + remote) |
| **Challenge** | Cut last-mile delivery carbon emissions 12% within 12 months while preserving SLA speed |
| **Participants** | 26 (drivers, route planners, data scientists, operations VPs, customer-success reps) |
| **Facilitators** | 2 CreateX leads + 1 remote champion |
| **Outcome Highlights** | • AI-enabled route-optimizer prototype → pilot ROI $1.4M < 6 mo<br>• Creative Confidence +2.6 (CCS-10)<br>• Workshop NPS +68 |

## 21.1 Context & Pre-Sprint Scoping

**Regulatory Push:** Québec set aggressive CO₂ targets; Acme faced potential fines  
**Data Wealth, Insight Scarcity:** Tera-bytes of telematics logs yet no actionable dashboards  
**Sponsor Goal:** Deliver a board-ready pilot plan in 4 days; secure budget at next QBR

**CreateX Scoping Moves:**

1. **Problem Statement (T-30 d)**  
   "How might we redesign last-mile operations so that Acme reduces CO₂ per parcel without lengthening delivery windows?"

2. **Stakeholder Map** identified municipal regulators and parcel recipients as silent but high-impact voices—two were invited to Day-2 testing

3. **AI Tool Pre-Check** — Legal approved GPT-4o use on anonymized route data; Whisper-Live for bilingual (EN/FR) transcription

## 21.2 Sprint Agenda (4 × 90 min × 4 days)

| Day | Diamond Stage | Key Activities | AI Assist |

| **1 AM** | Discover | Ride-along video playback · AEIOU tag storm | Whisper transcription |
| **1 PM** | Define | Affinity + Journey Map · HMW framing | GPT-theme cluster |
| **2 AM** | Develop | Brainwriting 6-3-5 · Crazy 8s | Gemini metaphor seed |
| **2 PM** | Develop | SCAMPER remix · Dot-vote | Heat-map overlay |
| **3 AM** | Prototype | Storyboards · Paper UI for Driver App | Galileo prompt-to-UI |
| **3 PM** | Test | Think-aloud (drivers) · Heuristic review | Sentiment timeline |
| **4 AM** | Deliver | Pilot Canvas · RACI · KPI board | GPT KPI auto-calc |
| **4 PM** | Reflection | AAR · Highlight reel edit | Auto-subtitles |

## 21.3 Prototype & Pilot

**Concept:** "Eco-Flex Route Optimizer" (EFR): dynamic geo-fencing redirects drivers to micro-hubs + e-bike couriers during urban congestion peaks

**Wizard-of-Oz:** Operations analyst manually pushed reroutes via SMS; simulated AI decisions

**Metrics Tested (n = 10 vans, 3 days):**

| Metric | Baseline | Pilot | Δ |
|--------|----------|-------|---|
| **Avg CO₂ / parcel** | 540 g | 468 g | -13.3% |
| **On-time rate** | 96.2% | 95.7% | -0.5 pp |
| **Driver satisfaction (1-5)** | 3.6 | 4.1 | +0.5 |

## 21.4 Impact & ROI

| Category | Detail |
|----------|---------|
| **Cost Saved** | Fuel -$740k / yr (projected) |
| **Revenue Protection** | Avoided CO₂ surcharge $300k |
| **Total ROI** | $1.4M within 6 months (investment $220k) |
| **AoCC Added** | 482 (ideas, prototypes, user tests logged) |

**Board approved scaling EFR to 5 cities; internal green-ops team formed (4 FTE).**

## 21.5 Creative Confidence Gains

| Measure | Pre | Post | Δ |
|---------|-----|------|---|
| **CCS-10 (avg)** | 5.7 | 8.3 | +2.6 |
| **Workshop NPS** | — | +68 | — |

**Qual quotes:**
- **"I never thought a driver's hunch could drive an AI model—now I do."** — Data Scientist
- **"The paper-app test showed me how fast we can pilot without code."** — Product VP

## 21.6 Lessons Learned

| Domain | Insight | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Hybrid Ops** | Remote planners felt sidelined during paper protos | Added live doc cam feed + remote scribes next sprint |
| **Data Quality** | GPS jitter skewed CO₂ calc | Implemented sensor fusion pre-processing |
| **Change Mgmt** | Driver union wary of "AI replacement" | Co-created training + incentive scheme; union rep on pilot team |

## 21.7 Replication Tips

1. **Ride-Along Videos** trump slide decks—sensory empathy accelerates urgency
2. **Wizard-of-Oz SMS** is cheap, controllable, and driver-friendly
3. **KPI Dashboard Scaffold** in Looker reduced analytics setup from weeks → hours
4. **Bilingual Transcripts** preserve nuance; FR-only jokes revealed morale levers
