## Overview

Creative problem-solving is the heart of innovation work. This chapter provides a comprehensive toolkit of methods for guiding groups through complex challenges, from initial problem definition through solution implementation. You'll learn to facilitate both divergent exploration and convergent decision-making with confidence and skill.

## 6.1 The Double Diamond Framework

### Understanding the Framework

The Double Diamond represents the creative problem-solving process as two connected diamonds:

**First Diamond - Problem Definition:**
- **Discover**: Explore and understand the problem space
- **Define**: Synthesize insights into focused problem statements

**Second Diamond - Solution Development:**
- **Develop**: Generate and explore potential solutions
- **Deliver**: Test, refine, and implement chosen solutions

### The Power of Divergence and Convergence

**Divergent Thinking:**
- Generates many options and possibilities
- Suspends judgment and criticism
- Encourages wild ideas and building
- Values quantity over initial quality

**Convergent Thinking:**
- Evaluates and selects best options
- Applies criteria and judgment
- Focuses on feasibility and impact
- Values refinement and decision-making

## 6.2 Phase 1: Discover - Understanding the Problem

### Problem Exploration Techniques

#### 1. Five Whys Analysis
Dig deeper into root causes through iterative questioning.

**Process:**
1. State the initial problem
2. Ask "Why does this happen?" 
3. For each answer, ask "Why?" again
4. Continue for five iterations
5. Identify deeper systemic issues

**Example:**
- Problem: "Our meetings are unproductive"
- Why? "People come unprepared"
- Why? "They don't know what's expected"
- Why? "Agendas aren't clear or sent early"
- Why? "We don't have a standard meeting process"
- Why? "Leadership hasn't prioritized meeting effectiveness"

#### 2. Stakeholder Mapping
Identify all people affected by or influencing the problem.

**Categories:**
- **Primary Stakeholders**: Directly affected by the problem
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Indirectly affected or influential
- **Key Players**: High influence on potential solutions
- **Hidden Stakeholders**: Often overlooked but important

#### 3. Journey Mapping
Map the current experience from different stakeholder perspectives.

**Elements:**
- Touchpoints and interactions
- Pain points and frustrations
- Moments of delight or success
- Emotions and feelings throughout
- Opportunities for improvement

### Research and Insight Generation

#### 1. Assumption Mapping
Make hidden assumptions visible for examination.

**Process:**
1. Brainstorm all assumptions about the problem
2. Categorize by confidence level (known, assumed, uncertain)
3. Prioritize assumptions that are high-impact and low-confidence
4. Design research to test key assumptions

#### 2. How Might We Questions
Reframe problems as opportunity statements.

**Formula**: "How might we..." + [desired outcome] + "so that" + [benefit]

**Examples:**
- "How might we make meetings more engaging so that people want to participate?"
- "How might we reduce wait times so that customers feel valued?"
- "How might we simplify onboarding so that new hires feel confident?"

## 6.3 Phase 2: Define - Synthesizing Insights

### Insight Synthesis Techniques

#### 1. Affinity Mapping
Group related insights to identify patterns and themes.

**Process:**
1. Write each insight on a separate sticky note
2. Silently group related insights together
3. Label each group with a theme name
4. Identify connections between groups
5. Synthesize into key insights

#### 2. Point of View Statements
Craft focused problem statements from a user perspective.

**Framework**: "[User] needs [need] because [insight]"

**Example**: "Busy working parents need quick, healthy meal solutions because they value family time but struggle with daily cooking demands."

#### 3. Design Principles
Establish criteria that solutions should meet.

**Examples:**
- "Solutions must be implementable within 30 days"
- "Must improve user experience without increasing costs"
- "Should be simple enough for anyone to use"

### Problem Reframing Techniques

#### 1. Perspective Shifting
View the problem from different angles and stakeholder positions.

**Questions:**
- "How would a child see this problem?"
- "What would someone from another culture think?"
- "How might our competitor approach this?"

#### 2. Scale Adjustment
Change the scope or scale of the problem definition.

**Scaling Up**: "If this problem affected 10x more people..."
**Scaling Down**: "If we focused on just one specific instance..."
**Time Shifting**: "If we had to solve this in 24 hours / 10 years..."

## 6.4 Phase 3: Develop - Generating Solutions

### Ideation Techniques

#### 1. Classic Brainstorming
Generate many ideas quickly without judgment.

**Rules:**
- Defer judgment
- Strive for quantity
- Build on ideas of others
- Stay focused on topic
- Encourage wild ideas
- Be visual

#### 2. Brainwriting (6-3-5 Method)
Silent idea generation to ensure equal participation.

**Process:**
1. 6 people each write 3 ideas in 5 minutes
2. Pass papers to the next person
3. Build on or add to existing ideas
4. Continue for 6 rounds
5. Harvest and combine ideas

#### 3. SCAMPER Technique
Systematic idea generation through different approaches.

- **Substitute**: What can be substituted?
- **Combine**: What can be combined?
- **Adapt**: What can be adapted?
- **Modify**: What can be modified or magnified?
- **Put to other uses**: How can this be used differently?
- **Eliminate**: What can be removed?
- **Reverse/Rearrange**: What can be reversed or rearranged?

#### 4. Worst Possible Idea
Generate intentionally bad ideas to break mental blocks.

**Benefits:**
- Reduces fear of judgment
- Often leads to genuinely good ideas
- Helps identify what NOT to do
- Creates laughter and energy

### Advanced Ideation Methods

#### 1. Random Word Technique
Use random stimuli to spark unexpected connections.

**Process:**
1. Select a random word from dictionary/list
2. Explore associations with that word
3. Force connections between word and problem
4. Build ideas from these forced relationships

#### 2. Role Playing Ideation
Generate ideas from different character perspectives.

**Characters:**
- Historical figures
- Fictional characters
- Industry leaders
- Different age groups
- Various professions

#### 3. Analogical Thinking
Find solutions by exploring how similar problems are solved elsewhere.

**Questions:**
- "How does nature solve this problem?"
- "How do other industries handle this?"
- "What would a completely different organization do?"

## 6.5 Phase 4: Deliver - Selecting and Implementing Solutions

### Convergent Evaluation Techniques

#### 1. Dot Voting
Quick visual method for group prioritization.

**Process:**
1. Display all ideas clearly
2. Give each person 3-5 dots
3. Allow silent voting on preferred ideas
4. Discuss top vote-getters
5. Make final selections

#### 2. Impact/Effort Matrix
Evaluate ideas based on potential impact and implementation effort.

**Quadrants:**
- **High Impact, Low Effort**: Quick wins (prioritize)
- **High Impact, High Effort**: Major projects (plan carefully)
- **Low Impact, Low Effort**: Fill-in tasks (do if time allows)
- **Low Impact, High Effort**: Avoid (generally not worth it)

#### 3. Six Thinking Hats
Examine ideas from different perspectives systematically.

**Hat Colors:**
- **White**: Facts and information
- **Red**: Emotions and feelings
- **Black**: Caution and critical thinking
- **Yellow**: Optimism and benefits
- **Green**: Creativity and alternatives
- **Blue**: Process and control

### Prototyping and Testing
