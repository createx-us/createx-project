# Chapter 10: Ideation Methods

**Track:** Design Process  
**Duration:** 55 min  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Prerequisites:** Chapter 9

## Learning Objectives

- Master key concepts from ideation methods
- Apply frameworks and methods in practice
- Understand implementation considerations

## Overview

Ideation transforms carefully defined challenges into a wide portfolio of potential solutions. This chapter covers systematic methods for generating, expanding, and selecting ideas while blending classic creativity techniques with AI co-ideation to super-charge output while preserving human originality.

**Core Principle:** Quantity precedes quality—the more ideas generated and remixed, the higher the odds of discovering breakthrough concepts.

## 10.0 Why Ideation?

Ideation is the creative heart of design thinking, where carefully defined challenges transform into a wide portfolio of potential solutions. Quantity precedes quality: the more ideas generated—and remixed—the higher the odds of discovering breakthrough concepts. CreateX blends classic creativity games with AI co‑ideation to super‑charge output while preserving human originality.

## 10.1 Brainwriting 6‑3‑5

**Purpose:** Rapidly harvest ideas from all participants, minimizing group‑think.

**When to Use:** Kick‑off of Ideation; warm‑up for quieter teams.

**Step‑by‑Step:** 6 people · 3 ideas each · 5 min round → pass sheet → repeat × 3 rounds (54 ideas).

**Remote Tips:** BoardX grid auto‑rotates idea cards to next participant.

**AI Prompt Ideas:** "Expand each idea into a one‑sentence concept description."

**Pitfalls:** Illegible handwriting; insist on clear, short phrasing.

## 10.2 Crazy 8s Sketch Storm

**Purpose:** Push thinkers past obvious solutions via time‑pressured sketching.

**When to Use:** After Brainwriting, to add visual diversity.

**Step‑by‑Step:** Fold A4 paper to 8 frames → 1 idea per 1 min → 8 ideas in 8 min.

**Remote Tips:** Use BoardX "8‑up canvas"; timer overlays each frame.

**AI Prompt Ideas:** "Generate a 3‑word title for each sketch to aid voting."

**Pitfalls:** Over‑polishing; remind "ugly is fine."

**Template:** createx.us/toolkit/crazy‑8s‑canvas

## 10.3 SCAMPER Remix

| Letter | Prompt | Quick Example (Remote Teaching App) |
|--------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| **S** Substitute | Swap ingredient or tech | Replace video with low‑bandwidth audio slides |
| **C** Combine | Merge features | Add real‑time captioning + note syncing |
| **A** Adapt | Borrow from another field | Use "story streak" from Duolingo for lessons |
| **M** Modify | Intensify / shrink | 5‑min micro‑lessons |
| **P** Put to Another Use | Re‑purpose | Turn whiteboard into homework tracker |
| **E** Eliminate | Remove element | No login—magic link per session |
| **R** Reverse | Flip order | Test before teach ("pre‑assessment first") |

**Purpose:** Systematically expand concept space via attribute manipulation.

**When to Use:** Mid‑Ideation when idea pool plateaus.

**Remote Tips:** SCAMPER dropdown menu auto‑cycles prompts every 2 min.

**AI Prompt Ideas:** "Apply SCAMPER to this concept: remote onboarding kit."

**Pitfalls:** Forcing fit; skip any letter that feels irrelevant.

**Template:** createx.us/toolkit/scamper‑cards

## 10.4 AI Co‑Ideation Blitz (15 min)

| Step | Action | Tool |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Feed top 3 HMWs into ChatGPT/Gemini | LLM |
| 2 | Ask for 20 wild concepts each (total 60) | — |
| 3 | Team scans outputs, tags "intriguing," "meh," "duplicate" | BoardX tag panel |
| 4 | Merge intriguing with human ideas | Affinity wall |
| 5 | Dot‑vote top 10 hybrid concepts | Voting plugin |

**Ethics Reminder:** AI suggestions are raw fodder, not final truth—evaluate feasibility, ethics, and user desirability.

## 10.5 Dot‑Voting & Heat‑Mapping

**Purpose:** Narrow a large idea pool democratically.

**When to Use:** After ≥ 40 ideas are surfaced.

**Step‑by‑Step:** Each person gets 3‑5 dots; silent place; cluster high‑density winners.

**Remote Tips:** BoardX heat‑map overlay visualizes vote density.

**AI Prompt Ideas:** "Summarize top‑voted ideas into a sortable table with key attributes."

**Pitfalls:** HiPPO bias—run silent vote before discussion.

**Template:** createx.us/toolkit/dot‑vote‑overlay

## 10.6 Concept Poster (1‑Pager)

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| **Name** | Punchy < 4 words |
| **Problem** | 1‑sentence user POV |
| **Solution Sketch** | Simple drawing or storyboard |
| **Value Proposition** | 2‑3 bullet benefits |
| **Key Assumptions** | List biggest unknowns |

Use posters to crystallize top concepts before prototyping.

## 10.7 Hybrid Ideation Agenda (90 min)

| Minute | Activity |
|--------|----------|
| 0‑10 | Warm‑up improv game ("Word‑Ball") |
| 10‑25 | Brainwriting 6‑3‑5 |
| 25‑35 | Crazy 8s |
| 35‑50 | AI Co‑Ideation Blitz |
| 50‑60 | Silent dot‑vote |
| 60‑90 | Teams create Concept Posters for top 3 ideas |

## 10.8 Common Pitfalls & Fixes

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Idea Saturation** (no fresh angles) | Introduce SCAMPER or random stimulus cards |
| **Dominator Syndrome** | Silent, written methods (brainwriting) first |
| **AI Flood** (too many low‑quality ideas) | Pre‑set relevancy filter: ignore ideas lacking user fit |

## Key Takeaways

- Varied methods tap different cognitive pathways—verbal, visual, associative
- AI acts as an idea multiplier, not replacement; curate ruthlessly
- Transition from divergence → convergence with objective dot‑votes and concept posters
- Preserve all ideas in a backlog; today's "crazy" may inspire tomorrow's pivot

## Reflection Questions

1. Which ideation method works best for your team's communication style?
2. How can you balance AI assistance with human creativity in your ideation sessions?
3. What strategies will you use to manage idea overload while preserving quality insights?
