# Chapter 7: Research & Empathy Methods

**Track:** Design Process  
**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Prerequisites:** Chapter 6

## Learning Objectives

- Master essential empathy and research methods for the Discover phase
- Apply AI-augmented research techniques effectively
- Learn to synthesize user insights rapidly and accurately
- Sequence research methods for maximum impact
- Avoid common research pitfalls and bias traps

## Overview

Every CreateX workshop begins with evidence, not assumption. Rigorous but lightweight research anchors later ideation in lived reality and keeps AI outputs grounded. This chapter gives you four high-leverage methods you can mix-and-match inside the Discover phase or as a refresher mid-project.

## 7.0 Why Research & Empathy?

### The Evidence Foundation
- **Grounds Solutions in Reality**: Prevents building for imaginary users
- **Challenges Assumptions**: Surfaces insights teams didn't know they needed
- **Creates Shared Understanding**: Aligns diverse perspectives on real user needs
- **Guides AI Outputs**: Provides human context for algorithmic generation

### The Speed Imperative
Traditional research can take months. CreateX methods compress discovery into hours while maintaining rigor through:
- **Targeted Methods**: High-impact techniques with clear outputs
- **AI Acceleration**: Automated transcription, clustering, and synthesis
- **Immediate Synthesis**: Real-time conversion from data to insights

## 7.1 Empathy Interviews

### Method Card

| **Section** | **Details** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Uncover motivations, pain points, and work-arounds straight from users' mouths. |
| **When to Use** | Early Discover or after a prototype sparks new questions. |
| **Step-by-Step** | 1) Draft open questions (why, how, tell-me-about). 2) Pair interviewer + note-taker. 3) Record consent. 4) Probe stories, not opinions. 5) Debrief immediately. |
| **Remote Tips** | Use BoardX's split-screen—live transcript on left, note affinity tags on right. |
| **AI Prompt Ideas** | "Summarize this 20-min transcript into key quotes + jobs + pains table." |
| **Pitfalls** | Leading questions; stacking multiple questions; skipping debrief (memory decay hits ~40% in 1h). |
| **Template** | createx.us/toolkit/empathy-interview-guide |

### Essential Interview Techniques

**Opening Questions:**
- "Tell me about the last time you [relevant activity]..."
- "Walk me through a typical [time period] in your [role/context]..."
- "What's most frustrating about [relevant process/tool]?"

**Probing Questions:**
- "Can you show me how you do that?"
- "What do you mean when you say [their term]?"
- "Help me understand why that matters to you..."

**Story Extraction:**
- "Tell me about a time when [situation] went really well..."
- "Describe the worst experience you've had with [topic]..."
- "What workarounds have you developed?"

### Interview Structure (20 minutes)

1. **Opening (2 min)**: Context setting and permission
2. **Current State (8 min)**: How they do things now
3. **Pain Points (5 min)**: Frustrations and challenges
4. **Ideal Future (3 min)**: What would make their life better
5. **Closing (2 min)**: Key insights confirmation

## 7.2 AEIOU Field Observation

### Framework Components

| **Component** | **What to Log** | **Example** |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Activities** | Goal-driven actions | "Teacher toggles between Zoom & WeChat every 2 min." |
| **Environments** | Physical/digital spaces | "Lighting glare obscures whiteboard after 3 pm." |
| **Interactions** | People, systems | "Student asks ChatGPT before raising hand." |
| **Objects** | Tools & artifacts | "Sticky notes fall off in humid rooms." |
| **Users** | Roles & values | "IT admin prioritizes security over speed." |

### Method Card

| **Section** | **Details** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Capture contextual nuances users often forget to mention. |
| **When to Use** | On-site or screen-share shadowing sessions. |
| **Remote Tips** | Ask participant to wear a chest-mounted phone camera, or screen-share full desktop. |
| **AI Prompt Ideas** | "Cluster observation notes into repeated patterns; output CSV with frequency." |
| **Pitfalls** | Observer bias. Use two observers when possible; compare notes. |
| **Template** | createx.us/toolkit/aeiou-canvas |

### Observation Best Practices

**Before Observing:**
- Set clear observation goals
- Prepare note-taking system
- Establish recording permissions
- Brief participants on natural behavior

**During Observation:**
- Focus on actions, not interpretations
- Note exact quotes and behaviors
- Capture environmental context
- Track time stamps for patterns

**After Observation:**
- Debrief within 1 hour
- Compare notes with co-observer
- Identify surprises and contradictions
- Extract behavioral patterns

## 7.3 Empathy Map (4‑Quadrant Variant)

### Quadrant Structure

| **Quadrant** | **Guiding Question** | **Sticky-Note Color** |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **See** | What does the user see around them? | Yellow |
| **Hear** | What are they hearing from others/media? | Blue |
| **Say & Do** | What do they verbally express or do? | Green |
| **Think & Feel** | What's on their mind or in their heart? | Pink |

### Method Card

| **Section** | **Details** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Synthesize raw research into shared mental model. |
| **When to Use** | Immediately after interviews/observations. |
| **Step-by-Step** | 1) Time-box 10 min silent sticky dump. 2) Read out loud clockwise. 3) Star-vote top 3 insights. |
| **Remote Tips** | BoardX template auto-color-codes by quadrant. |
| **AI Prompt Ideas** | "Generate an insight statement (user + need + why) for each top sticky cluster." |
| **Pitfalls** | Guessing feelings; ensure every sticky ties to observed evidence. |
| **Template** | createx.us/toolkit/empathy-map |

### Empathy Mapping Process

**Preparation (5 minutes):**
- Set up quadrant template
- Distribute colored stickies
- Review research data together
- Set timer for focused work

**Silent Populate (10 minutes):**
- Individual sticky writing
- One insight per sticky
- Ground in specific evidence
- Use participant's own words

**Share & Cluster (15 minutes):**
- Read stickies aloud by quadrant
- Group similar themes
- Identify patterns and contradictions
- Vote on most significant insights

## 7.4 Jobs‑to‑Be‑Done Quick Canvas

### JTBD Framework

| **Field** | **Example** |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Job Statement** | "When onboarding remote staff, I want a single checklist so I feel confident nothing is missed." |
| **Current Hacks** | Manual Google Sheets checklist |
| **Pains** | "Version control issues; new hires confused." |
| **Gains** | "Faster ramp-up, less IT tickets." |

### Method Card

| **Section** | **Details** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Frame user needs as progress they seek, detaching from current solutions. |
| **When to Use** | When solution scope feels predetermined; to widen perspective. |
| **AI Prompt Ideas** | "Rewrite these interview quotes into structured JTBD statements with Situation-Motivation-Expected Outcome." |
| **Pitfalls** | Writing vague jobs ("communicate better"); test with the swap test ("Would a different persona have this job?"). |
| **Template** | createx.us/toolkit/jtbd-canvas |

### JTBD Statement Formula

**Structure**: "When [situation], I want [motivation] so I can [expected outcome]."

**Quality Check Questions:**
- Is this specific to a situation?
- Does it focus on progress, not features?
- Would other personas have different jobs?
- Can we measure success?

## 7.5 Stakeholder Mapping Lite

### Mapping Framework

- **Axis X**: Influence (Low to High)
- **Axis Y**: Interest (Low to High)
- **Focus**: High-influence/high-interest as "Power Allies"

**AI Assist**: "Suggest unseen stakeholders based on domain-specific ontologies."

### Stakeholder Categories

**Champions**: High interest, high influence
**Gatekeepers**: Low interest, high influence  
**Advocates**: High interest, low influence
**Observers**: Low interest, low influence

## 7.6 AI‑Powered Research Ops

### Traditional vs. AI-Augmented Workflow

| **Task** | **Traditional** | **AI-Augmented** |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Transcription** | Manual typing (4-6× runtime) | Real-time LLM transcribe + speaker diarization |
| **Translation** | Human bilingual | LLM zero-shot > 85% accuracy |
| **Theming** | Sticky clustering | Top 10 topic clusters with confidence scores |
| **Sentiment** | Manual color-coding | VADER or GPT sentiment + outlier alert |

**Ethics Note**: Secure consent for AI processing; redact PII before cloud upload.

### AI Implementation Guidelines

**Data Privacy:**
- Explicit consent for AI processing
- Local processing when possible
- PII redaction before cloud upload
- Secure data storage and deletion

**Quality Assurance:**
- Human validation of AI outputs
- Bias scanning for generated content
- Confidence scoring for clusters
- Manual review of outliers

## 7.7 Choosing & Sequencing Methods

### Time-Based Sequences

| **Constraint** | **Recommended Flow** |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **90 min** | 20 min Empathy Interview (live), 10 min Rapid Debrief, 30 min Empathy Map, 20 min JTBD distillation, 10 min break. |
| **Half-Day** | AEIOU → Stakeholder Map → Empathy Interviews × 3 → Empathy Map → JTBD. |
| **Budget $0** | Remote interview via WhatsApp + free Otter transcript; BoardX sticky wall. |

### Selection Criteria

**For Deep Understanding**: Empathy Interviews + AEIOU
**For Quick Validation**: JTBD + Stakeholder Map
**For Complex Systems**: All methods in sequence
**For Remote Teams**: Empathy Map + AI-powered synthesis

## 7.8 Common Pitfalls Across Methods & Fixes

| **Pitfall** | **Fix** |
|-------------|---------|
| **Data Swamp** (too many notes) | Force synthesis within 24h; use AI summarizer. |
| **Participant Bias** (social desirability) | Ask for work-arounds and last time stories ("Describe the last time you…?"). |
| **Over-reliance on AI themes** | Manually sanity-check anomalies; compare to raw quotes. |

### Additional Pitfalls

**Leading Questions**: Ask "Tell me about..." instead of "Don't you think..."
**Confirmation Bias**: Actively seek disconfirming evidence
**Sample Bias**: Ensure diverse participant representation
**Recency Bias**: Weight all evidence equally, not just recent interviews

## 7.9 Key Takeaways

- **Triangulate** — combine at least two methods for richer insight
- **AI accelerates mechanics**; human curiosity drives depth and ethics
- **Capture evidence, synthesize fast**, and convert to actionable How-Might-We seeds

### Research Success Factors

1. **Start with Clear Questions**: What do we need to learn?
2. **Mix Methods Strategically**: Different techniques reveal different insights
3. **Synthesize Rapidly**: Convert data to insights within 24 hours
4. **Stay User-Centered**: Focus on real needs, not assumed problems
5. **Document Everything**: Make insights accessible to the whole team
