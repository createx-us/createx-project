# Chapter 13: Implementation & Road‑Mapping

**Track:** Design Process  
**Duration:** 65 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Prerequisites:** Chapter 12

## Learning Objectives

- Bridge the innovation-delivery gap from prototype to pilot
- Master pilot planning using canvas and decision frameworks
- Apply RACI, OKRs, and agile delivery methodologies
- Design effective change management and adoption strategies
- Implement risk management and sustainability planning

## Overview

A validated prototype is only a promissory note until real users adopt it. Implementation bridges the "innovation-delivery gap," translating workshop momentum into shipped value. This stage aligns resources, clarifies ownership, and plots the shortest viable path to measurable impact.

## 13.0 Why Implementation Matters

### The Innovation-Delivery Gap

**The Challenge:**
- Many great prototypes never reach real users
- Workshop momentum dissipates without clear next steps
- Innovation teams struggle to align with delivery teams
- Resource allocation becomes unclear after initial validation

**Implementation's Role:**
- **Translates Prototypes**: From concept to working solution
- **Aligns Resources**: People, budget, and infrastructure
- **Clarifies Ownership**: Who does what, when, and how
- **Plots Viable Path**: Shortest route to measurable impact

### Success Metrics for Implementation

**Process Metrics:**
- Time from prototype to pilot launch
- Stakeholder alignment scores
- Resource utilization efficiency
- Risk mitigation effectiveness

**Outcome Metrics:**
- User adoption rates
- Value delivery against targets
- Sustainability beyond pilot phase
- Learning integration into next cycles

## 13.1 From Prototype to Pilot — Decision Matrix

### Decision Criteria Framework

| **Criterion** | **Green Light** | **Yellow** | **Red Light** |
|---------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|
| **User Value** | SUS ≥ 75, NPS ≥ +30 | Mixed feedback | Clear rejection / low usage |
| **Feasibility** | Tech ready in ≤ 4 weeks | Moderate refactor | Requires new platform |
| **Strategic Fit** | Aligns with OKR | Adjacent | Off-strategy |
| **Risk/Ethics** | No red flags | Mitigatable | High regulatory / bias risk |

**Rule**: Must score green on User + Strategic, and ≤ one yellow elsewhere.

### Decision Process

**Step 1: Assess Each Criterion**
- Gather evidence for each dimension
- Use consistent scoring methodology
- Document reasoning for scores
- Involve diverse stakeholder perspectives

**Step 2: Apply Decision Rule**
- Must have green on User Value AND Strategic Fit
- Maximum one yellow in remaining criteria
- Any red flag requires addressing before proceeding
- Clear escalation path for borderline cases

**Step 3: Document Decision**
- Record rationale for future reference
- Set review dates for reassessment
- Communicate decision to all stakeholders
- Plan next steps based on outcome

## 13.2 Pilot Planning Canvas

### Canvas Framework

| **Block** | **Prompt** |
|-----------|------------|
| **Pilot Objective** | Specific KPI (e.g., +15% task completion) |
| **Scope & Features** | "Must-have" list; trim niceties |
| **User Cohort** | Who, how many, recruitment method |
| **Success Metrics** | Baseline, target, measurement tool |
| **Timeline** | Kickoff → Week 1 alpha → Week 4 debrief |
| **Resources** | People (FTE), budget, infra |
| **Risks & Mitigations** | Top 3 blockers + action owner |

**Template Link**: createx.us/toolkit/pilot-canvas

### Canvas Completion Guidelines

**Pilot Objective:**
- SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Clear connection to business outcomes
- Testable hypotheses about value creation
- Alignment with organizational OKRs

**Scope Definition:**
- MVP feature set only
- Clear boundaries on what's included/excluded
- Prioritization based on user value
- Technical feasibility considerations

**User Cohort:**
- Representative of target market
- Manageable size for meaningful feedback
- Accessible for research and testing
- Motivated to participate in pilot

## 13.3 RACI for Cross‑Functional Delivery

### RACI Matrix Framework

| **Role** | **Sample Stakeholder** | **Responsibility** |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **R - Responsible** | Product Owner | Drives day-to-day tasks |
| **A - Accountable** | VP Innovation | Final decision authority |
| **C - Consulted** | Legal, Data Privacy | Provide guidance |
| **I - Informed** | Customer Success | Receive status updates |

**Tip**: Map RACI onto a Gantt; surface overloads early.

### RACI Implementation Best Practices

**Clear Definitions:**
- Only one Accountable per deliverable
- Multiple Responsible parties with clear coordination
- Consulted parties provide input when requested
- Informed parties receive updates at agreed intervals

**Regular Reviews:**
- Weekly RACI check-ins during pilot
- Adjust assignments based on workload
- Escalate conflicts quickly
- Document changes and rationale

## 13.4 OKRs & Key Results Cascade

### OKR Hierarchy Example

| **Level** | **Objective** | **Key Results** |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Company** | "Grow AI-assisted revenue streams." | KR1: +$2M ARR from AI products by Q4 |
| **Team** | "Launch remote onboarding kit pilot." | KR1: 200 paid seats, KR2: Churn < 3% |
| **Individual** | "Integrate sentiment analytics." | KR1: Deploy model with > 85% F1 by June |

**AI Assist**: "Suggest stretch but realistic KR values based on past cohort data."

### OKR Best Practices

**Setting Effective OKRs:**
- Objectives are inspirational and qualitative
- Key Results are measurable and time-bound
- Ambitious but achievable (70% success rate target)
- Clear ownership and accountability

**Cascade Alignment:**
- Individual KRs support team objectives
- Team objectives support company goals
- Regular check-ins on progress
- Transparent sharing across organization

## 13.5 Road‑Map Formats

### Format Selection Guide

| **Format** | **Best For** | **Pro** |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Now / Next / Later** | Fast-moving startups | Simplicity |
| **Gantt + Swimlanes** | Enterprise compliance | Dependency clarity |
| **Outcome-Based (OKR Board)** | Mission-driven NGOs | Focus on value vs. output |

**Tooling**: BoardX Road-Map plugin auto-links tasks to BoardX, Jira, Trello.
