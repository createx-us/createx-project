## 17.0 Facilitator as Guide · Guru · Guardrail

A CreateX facilitator juggles three fluid roles:

| Role | Core Question | Hallmark Behaviours |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Guide** | "Where do we go next?" | Asks catalytic questions, invites participation, redirects energy |
| **Guru** | "What knowledge unlocks the block?" | Injects concise expertise or demo, never monologues |
| **Guardrail** | "How do we stay on track and safe?" | Manages time boxes, maintains psychological safety, enforces ethics |

**Skilful facilitation is knowing when to switch hats—and when to stay silent.**

## 17.1 Core Communication Micro-Skills

| Skill | Description | Quick Drill |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Active Listening** | Mirror back essence: "What I'm hearing is..." | Partner shares a gripe; reflect without advice |
| **Powerful Questions** | Open, short, bias-free: "What makes this important now?" | Rewrite five prompts, strip out verbs improve/fix/should |
| **Neutral Re-Voicing** | Depersonalise conflict: "One perspective we've heard is..." | Replace pronouns with "the team" |
| **Positive Constraint** | Turn block into challenge: "Given 15 minutes, what can we test?" | Time-box random household task to 3 min |
| **Body-Energy Match** | Align gestures, tone, posture with activity phase | Record a 1-min stand-up & seated reflection, compare energy |

## 17.2 Psychological Safety Techniques

| Technique | When to Use | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Check-In Rounds** | Kick-off & post-break | Each shares weather emoji of mind |
| **Working Agreements** | Start of day | Co-create 5 norms; vote; post visibly |
| **1-2-4-All** | Divergent discussion | Solo think → pair → foursome → whole group |
| **Red-Card / Green-Card** | Conflict emerges | Anyone can flag process pause (red) or move on (green) |
| **Anonymous Input** | Hierarchical groups | Use digital sticky or Sli.do for silent suggestions |

**AI Assist:** Sentiment tracker in BoardX flags sudden polarity drops (> 0.4 change); facilitator investigates.

## 17.3 Managing Group Dynamics

| Situation | Symptom | Intervention |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Turf Dominance** | One voice dominates | Use "Two Voices Before Repeat" rule; pass talking token |
| **Idea Freeze** | Silence, blank faces | Random-stimulus card, SCAMPER prompt, AI wildcard |
| **Side-Chats** | Whispering, distracted | Assign listener role to those participants; ask for summary |
| **Conflict Escalation** | Raised tone, cross-talk | Switch to "Yes-And" paraphrase round; focus on data |
| **Decision Deadlock** | Endless debate | Shift to structured vote; use impact/effort matrix |

## 17.4 Language Patterns that Unlock Thinking

| Instead of... | Say... | Why it Works |
|---------------|--------|--------------|
| **"That won't work."** | "What assumptions would need to change for this to work?" | Keeps door ajar for iteration |
| **"We don't have time."** | "Given 10 minutes, what slice could we test?" | Time-box reframes |
| **"Who's right?"** | "What data might resolve this?" | Moves from ego to evidence |
| **"Any ideas?"** | "List three wild ideas that would delight our user's grandma." | Adds specificity, playful trigger |

## 17.5 AI-Enhanced Facilitation Moves

| Move | Tool | Prompt |
|------|------|--------|
| **Real-Time Synth** | GPT-assist | "Summarise top themes from sticky cluster A in < 60 words." |
| **Bias Spotter** | OpenAI moderation | "Check this HMW list for exclusionary language." |
| **Energy Poll** | BoardX bot | "Drop a ⚡ if energised, 💤 if tired." Calculates live bar chart |
| **Silent Brainstorm Booster** | ChatGPT | Provides 5 extra seeds per participant, private DM |

**Guardrail:** Disclose AI role; allow opt-out for privacy.

## 17.6 Time-Box Mastery

1. **Visible Timer** — Large screen or physical cube
2. **Auditory Cue** — Gentle gong vs. jarring buzzer; consistent
3. **Verbal Foreshadow** — "Two-minute warning" cue
4. **Grace Buffer** — Build 10% slack into agenda for overruns
5. **Celebratory Cut-Off** — Cheer when timebox ends—makes stopping positive

## 17.7 Facilitator Self-Management

| Domain | Practice |
|--------|----------|
| **Physical** | Stretch bands, hydration every 90 min, voice warm-ups |
| **Cognitive** | Agenda mental rehearsal, "if-then" contingency mapping |
| **Emotional** | Pre-session grounding: 3-breath box breathing; post-session journal dump |
| **Digital** | Dark-mode tools, notification silencing macros |

**Burnout Sign:** Irritability at small overruns. **Remedy:** Micro-break + peer co-facilitation.

## 17.8 Co-Facilitation Patterns

| Pattern | Best When | Tips |
|---------|-----------|------|
| **Lead + Producer** | Large hybrid events | Producer handles tech; Lead focuses on flow |
| **Ping-Pong** | Long sessions | Swap every activity; keeps voices fresh |
| **Subject + Process** | Technical domain | Expert shares, facilitator guides exercises |
| **Mentor + Apprentice** | Skill building | Apprentice leads low-risk blocks, debriefs |

## 17.9 Common Pitfalls & Fixes

| Pitfall | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **Lecture Trap** | Guru overuse | Set 7-minute max talk chunk |
| **Invisible Remote Participants** | Camera off, silent | Remote Champion call-outs; round-robin responses |
| **AI Over-Shine** | Model steals limelight | Use AI as sidekick; always human voice finalises |
| **Process Rigidness** | Guardrail overdrive | Schedule "flex windows" for serendipity |
