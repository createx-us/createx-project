## Overview

Competency Map & Certification Path provides a structured journey for facilitation mastery, combining skill assessment, community recognition, and continuous growth through evidence-based competency evaluation.

## 25.0 Opening Story

"I thought I was done after my first big workshop‚Äîturns out I'd just unlocked Level 2."

When CreateX volunteer Leila Barros finished facilitating a 50-person NGO sprint, she expected a polite "thank you." Instead, she received an email: "Congrats, you've advanced to Guide certification‚Äîhere's your feedback and next-level challenges." The structured path surprised her and lit a new goal: become an Architect by year's end. Leila's journey embodies the CreateX philosophy: facilitation is a craft with clear milestones, feedback loops, and community recognition.
