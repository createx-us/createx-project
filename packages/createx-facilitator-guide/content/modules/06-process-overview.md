# Chapter 6: Process Overview: The CreateX Double‑Diamond × Sprint Loop

**Track:** Design Process  
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Prerequisites:** Chapter 5

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the CreateX process framework combining double-diamond with sprint methodology
- Learn to manage timing and energy across design thinking phases
- Apply AI integration strategically throughout the process

## Overview

CreateX combines the proven double-diamond methodology with rapid sprint cycles to create a flexible, scalable framework for innovation. This chapter provides the process architecture that guides all CreateX workshops.

## 6.0 Opening Story

*"We finished a whole 'diamond' before lunch."*

At a Montréal civic-tech hackathon, facilitator Sofia Bélanger challenged her cohort to compress a full Discover-to-Define cycle into three hours, powered by live-transcribed street interviews and a GPT-4o clustering bot. By midday, teams had reframed their briefs twice and were already ideating. Sofia's experiment illustrates CreateX's signature rhythm: macro structure with micro speed.

## 6.1 Why a Process Overview?

### Benefits of Structured Process

- **Common Language** — Unites multidisciplinary teams in minutes
- **Predictable Cadence** — Reduces cognitive load so energy focuses on insight, not logistics  
- **Plug-and-Play** — Allows facilitators to swap methods or AI tools without breaking flow

### Process vs. Chaos
While creativity requires some ambiguity, teams perform better with clear structure:
- Reduces anxiety about "what comes next"
- Enables better time and energy management
- Creates accountability and momentum
- Allows for meaningful progress tracking

## 6.2 The Classic Double‑Diamond

```
Discover  ◆  Develop  ◆
    ◆  Define  ◆  Deliver
 Divergent  ◆  Divergent  ◆
──────────┼───────────┼──────────
    ◆  Convergent  ◆
```

| Phase | Goal | Divergence/Convergence |
|-------|------|------------------------|
| **Discover** | Explore the problem space, build empathy | Divergent |
| **Define** | Synthesize insights, craft POV & HMW | Convergent |
| **Develop** | Generate and prototype solutions | Divergent |
| **Deliver** | Test, refine, and launch pilots | Convergent |

### Why Double-Diamond Works

1. **Mirrors Natural Problem-Solving**: Alternates between opening and focusing
2. **Prevents Premature Solutions**: Forces problem exploration before solution generation
3. **Balances Creativity and Feasibility**: Structured divergence with disciplined convergence
4. **Scalable Framework**: Works for 90-minute workshops or 90-day innovation programs

## 6.3 CreateX Micro‑Sprint Loop (90 minutes)

| Minute | Activity | Output | AI Assist |
|--------|----------|---------|-----------|
| **0-10** | **Frame** | Sprint goal & KPI card | GPT summary of previous sprint |
| **10-25** | **Diverge** | 20-30 raw ideas | Idea-spark prompts, image gen |
| **25-35** | **Cluster & Vote** | Top 3 concepts | LLM clustering, sentiment heat-map |
| **35-60** | **Prototype** | Click-through, storyboard, or paper mock | Auto-layout, copy suggestions |
| **60-75** | **Test** | User feedback matrix | Real-time transcription + AI sentiment |
| **75-90** | **Reflect & Plan** | Decision on next sprint focus | GPT retro: keep, drop, tweak |

**Rule of Thumb**: 4 micro-sprints ≈ 1 diamond half

### Sprint Loop Benefits

- **Rapid Learning Cycles**: Fast feedback and iteration
- **Sustained Energy**: Variety prevents workshop fatigue
- **Clear Progress**: Tangible outputs every 90 minutes
- **AI Integration Points**: Natural moments for tool insertion

## 6.4 Zoom Out: Combining Diamonds + Sprints

| Time Horizon | Artifact | Decision Gate |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| **Day 0 (Kickoff)** | Challenge Canvas | "Go / refine brief" |
| **Day 1-2** | Diamond ① Discover → Define | Locked HMW + success metrics |
| **Day 3-4** | Diamond ② Develop → Deliver | MVP pilot scope |
| **Weeks 2-4** | Pilot Experiments | Investment or scale decision |

### Integration Architecture

**Daily Level**: 4-6 sprint loops per day
**Diamond Level**: 8-12 sprints per diamond half
**Program Level**: Multiple diamonds for complex challenges

## 6.5 AI Plug‑In Map

| Stage | High‑Impact AI Tools | Prompt Template |
|-------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Discover** | Transcription, entity extraction, semantic clustering | "Summarize top pain points across 12 interviews in 5 bullets." |
| **Define** | Theme clustering, gap analysis | "Generate 10 HMW statements ranked by novelty & feasibility." |
| **Develop** | LLM ideation, generative imagery, code autopilot | "Re-skin this concept for elderly users, output Figma JSON." |
| **Deliver** | A/B test simulation, sentiment analysis, AutoML forecasting | "Predict adoption curve given these persona parameters." |

**Ethics Check**: Run bias scan on AI outputs at each hand-off.

### AI Integration Principles

1. **Augment, Don't Replace**: AI accelerates human creativity, doesn't substitute it
2. **Transparency**: Always disclose AI assistance to participants
3. **Human Judgment**: Final decisions remain with human facilitators and participants
4. **Bias Awareness**: Regular checks for algorithmic bias in generated content

## 6.6 Timing & Energy Management

| Block Length | Purpose | Break Suggestion |
|--------------|---------|------------------|
| **25 min** | Cognitive sprint max before fatigue | 5-min stretch, hydrate |
| **90 min** | One complete micro-loop | 10-min "bio & buffer" |
| **180 min** | Half-diamond | 20-min meal / walk |

### Energy Flow Management

**Morning Energy (High)**: Complex problem framing, synthesis work
**Midday Energy (Medium)**: Collaborative ideation, building activities  
**Afternoon Energy (Variable)**: Testing, reflection, planning

**Facilitator Tip**: Display a large, visible timer; switch who owns the timer each sprint to share ownership.

### Attention Management

- **Variety**: Mix individual, pair, and group work
- **Movement**: Include physical activities and spatial changes
- **Sensory**: Engage multiple senses through materials and methods
- **Challenge**: Balance difficulty to maintain flow state

## 6.7 Process Adaptations

| Context | Modification |
|---------|--------------|
| **Remote-Only** | Add 5 extra minutes per sprint for tech lag; use smaller breakout groups (≤ 5). |
| **Enterprise Risk-Averse** | Extend Define stage, add "Compliance Desk Check" before prototyping. |
| **Social-Impact Fieldwork** | Discover phase may last days; embed local co-researchers to maintain trust. |

### Additional Adaptations

**Educational Settings**:
- Slower pace with more reflection time
- Academic grading integration points
- Theory-practice connection moments

**Healthcare Contexts**:
- Patient safety checkpoints
- Regulatory compliance reviews
- Clinical evidence requirements

**Startup Environments**:
- Faster cycles with higher risk tolerance
- Resource constraint considerations
- Market validation emphasis

## 6.8 Common Pitfalls & Safeguards

| Pitfall | Symptom | Safeguard |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Front-Loading Research** | Endless interviews, no synthesis | Time-box Discover; require first insight share by hour 4. |
| **Prototype Paralysis** | Teams polishing instead of testing | Enforce paper-first rule; user test must occur by sprint 2. |
| **AI Overwhelm** | Tool hopping derails focus | Pre-select 1-2 AI tools per stage; provide cheat-sheet links. |

### Additional Pitfalls

**Diamond Skipping**:
- **Symptom**: Jumping directly to solutions without problem exploration
- **Safeguard**: Mandatory problem validation before ideation begins

**Sprint Rigidity**:
- **Symptom**: Forcing activities into time boxes regardless of progress
- **Safeguard**: Build 15% flex time into each sprint for emergence

**Output Obsession**:
- **Symptom**: Focusing on deliverables rather than learning
- **Safeguard**: Equal emphasis on insights gained and artifacts created

## 6.9 Key Takeaways

- **Double-Diamond gives macro clarity; 90-min sprints give micro momentum**
- **AI inserts acceleration, not replacement—human judgment gates each phase**
- **Time-boxing, visible artifacts, and ethics checks keep velocity aligned with value**
- **Adapt process length and rigor to context, but never skip the reflection loop**

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Process Discipline**: Follow the framework while remaining flexible
2. **Energy Awareness**: Read and respond to group energy throughout
3. **Progress Visibility**: Make learning and decisions transparent
4. **Reflection Integration**: Regular pause points for synthesis and planning
5. **Context Adaptation**: Modify timing and methods for specific situations
